<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"><u>Conservation
of Energy</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> Energy can be
transfered from potential to kinetic and vice versa. This transfer can
occur without any loss of total energy which means that energy is
conserved. This conservation of energy occurs when external forces
acting on an object do not alter its total energy.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Consider the
falling 1.0
kg object below: The object is a projectile under the
influence of gravity but if there is no air resistance, the energy is
conserved. We will use our projectile equations to determine the
kinematics of the falling object at five instants during the first 2
seconds of flight.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Now that we
know the kinematics, we can calculate the potential, kinetic and total
energy of the 1 kg object at each instant in time. Notice that the
total energy is conserved while there is a transfer of potential energy
to kinetic energy as the object falls.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another example
of the conservation of energy is a pendulum. We know that as a pendulum
swings back and forth, it has zero velocity at the high point and as it
swings downward, it gains velocity. This means that as it loses
potential energy, it gains kinetic energy. As the pendulum passes the
low point at the bottom, it is moving fastest. As it swings upward
again, it slows down and its kinetic energy is transfered back to
potential energy. If there is no friction or air resistance, the
pendulum would swing forever.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the case when
forces alter the energy of an object, work is done and we will look
into this in the next lecture.</font></p>
