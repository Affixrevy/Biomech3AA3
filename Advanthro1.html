Technique</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In a previous
lecture ( <a href="anthro2.html">anthropometry</a>
)
we used a "look-up" table to calculate the segment masses, locations of
the center of mass(CM) and moments of inertia of human limb segments.
&nbsp;It was explained how mass could be determined with a scale
and the CM could be determined by balancing the segment on a knife
edge. &nbsp;The moment of inertia (I) determination was not
explained. &nbsp;In this lecture we start with an explanation of
the Pendulum Technique which is a valuable method for cadaveric
segments as well as other objects such as prosthetic limbs, tennis
rackets or any other artificial device used in human motion.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">
&nbsp;We can determine the moment of inertia of any object that is
suspended and allowed to swing through a small range (less than 10<sup>o</sup>).
The period of oscillation is dependent on the moment of inertia, the
mass of the object, the distance the axis is from the CM and gravity.
&nbsp;Once we know I about the swinging axis, we can use the
parallel
axis theorem to determine the moment of inertia about any other point
and also the radius of gyration (k).&nbsp;</font></p>

that we know
the moment of inertia of the tennis racket is 0.025 kg.m<sup>2</sup>,
what is the moment of inertia about an elbow if which&nbsp;is 0.20m
further&nbsp;away and the shoulder which is 0.43m away from the
axis in

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Hanavan Model</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The human body
has
been simplified to a system of standard geometric solids of constant
density in order to determine the location of center of mass and
moments of inertia. &nbsp;The diagram to the right shows the model
created by Hanavan that consisted of cylinders, spheres, and frustra
(tapered cylinders).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">One advantage of
these models is that they are mathematically easy to implement and they
can be scaled to individuals of different proportions by using segment
lengths rather than whole body height and weight.</font></p>

Change
Method: &nbsp;This method was covered on the previous page.</font></p>
<p><img src="advanthro9.jpg" align="right" height="453" width="300"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">4) Water
Immersion
Method: The volume of human limb segments can be measured by immersing
them in water and measuring the amount of water displaced.
&nbsp;This
volume can be converted to mass by multiplying the volume by a density
estimate. &nbsp;This method was first used by Harlis in the 1850's and
can also yield the location of the center of gravity if density can be
assumed to be evenly distributed throughout the segment.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">5) Quick Release
Method: &nbsp;The moment of inertia of a human limb segment can be
calculated by placing an accelerometer on the limb and securing the
limb with a cable attached to a force transducer. &nbsp;The subject
contracts the muscles against the force transducer which records the
applied moment of force. &nbsp;The limb is then released which
causes
it to accelerate due to the muscle forces. &nbsp;The force
transducer
is multiplied by the moment arm to get the applied moment and it is
then divided by the tangential acceleration to yield the moment of
inertia.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">DXA machines are
traditionally used to estimate bone density. &nbsp;Patients are
scanned
by two photon beams of different power . &nbsp;As the beams pass
through the tissues, their energies are absorbed and a calculation can
be made regarding the amount (mass) of tissue as well as the
composition
of bone, fat and lean tissue. &nbsp;Dowling, Durkin, et al. have
shown
that the scanned elements can be plotted in a "mass map", in which the
height of each element is proportional to the amount of mass (see lower
figure).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The mass map can
be
divided digitally in a similar way to a cadaver dissection and the
mass, center of mass and moment of inertia can be determined for each
body segment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The procedure
exposes the subject to a low
dose of radiation and is very accurate. &nbsp;However, the machines
are
expensive and the process is quite time consuming. &nbsp;Currently,
this method is mostly been used in research to build more accurate
elliptical models.</font></p>
