<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In
the previous lecture ( <a href="fluid1.html">fluid
mechanics</a>
)
we&nbsp;examined surface and form drag. &nbsp;In this lecture
we
combine these into a single drag coefficient (C<sub>D</sub>)
and look
more closely at the other factors that contribute to drag.&nbsp;
The
drag force is the product of the drag coefficient, the density of the
fluid, the projected area and the velocity squared.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Fluid density
was covered in the buoyancy portion of the <a href="fluid1.html">fluid
mechanics</a> lecture.
&nbsp;Some examples are: fresh water (1000kg/m<sup>3</sup>),
salt water (1024kg/m<sup>3</sup>),
and air 1.2 (kg/m<sup>3</sup>).</font></p>
<p><img src="drag3.jpg" align="right" height="199" width="420"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Projected area
is the cross sectional area perpendicular to the relative fluid flow.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The coefficient
of drag is often determined in a wind tunnel. &nbsp;The object is
tethered with a force transducer to measure the drag force while air is
blown at known velocities. &nbsp;Since the fluid density is known
and the projected area can be easily measured the coefficient of drag
is the only unknown and can be calculated using the above formula.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example: Find
the drag force of a cyclist riding at 30 km/hr given: C<sub>D</sub>
= 0.33 and A<sub>P</sub>
= 1.5 m<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Solution:
30km/hr = 30(1000)/3600 = 8.33 m/s and the fluid density of air is 1.2
kg/m<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, F<sub>D</sub>
= 1/2(0.33)(1.2)(1.5)(8.33)<sup>2</sup>
= 20.6N</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;The
drag force may seem small (20.6 N) but the
power required to ride at that speed is the product of force and
velocity (see power lecture). &nbsp;In this case, the cyclist must
produce 20.6(8.33) = 172 W of power just to overcome the air
resistance. &nbsp;The rolling friction of a bicycle is quite small
so most of the energy demands are against drag. &nbsp;If the
cyclist was to increase speed to 36 km/hr (10 m/s), the drag force
would
increase to 29.7 N and the power would increase to 297 W.
&nbsp;This is an 80% increase in power required for a 20% increase
in
speed.
&nbsp;Reducing the drag coefficient is very important in
competitive cycling and riding behind another cyclist&nbsp;reduces
the projected area.</font></p>

and Power-Velocity Relations and Cycling Cadence</big>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
force-velocity relation of skeletal muscle was reviewed in the muscle
mechanics lecture. Recall that muscle generates less force as the speed
of shortening&nbsp;in a concentric contraction increases. Since
power
is the
product of force and velocity, we could also plot the power-velocity
relation of skeletal muscle.
</font></p>

<p><img src="drag5.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="400"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In the above
graph, we can see the hyperbolic decrease in force with increases in
shortening velocity. &nbsp;When velocity is zero
(isometric contraction), the force is high but the power is zero due to
zero velocity. As the velocity increases, the power increases yet
returns to zero at maximum velocity because force is zero.
&nbsp;Notice that there is an optimum power at about one third the
maximum velocity.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">For the
cyclist, there is a pedaling frequency (cadence) that allows the
muscles to shorten at velocities near the optimum power. &nbsp;For
recreational cyclists that cadence is about 80 revolutions per minute
while elite cyclists are generally over 90 rpm. &nbsp;Everyone who
has ridden a bicycle up and down a steep hill has experienced the large
forces that must be applied when the cadence decreases on hill climb
and small amount of force that can be applied to the pedal with the
high cadence when descending rapidly. &nbsp;This is a good example
of the force-velocity relation in practice. &nbsp;By changing gears
on the bicycle, the rider can maintain a cadence that allows optimal
power delivery throughout the hill climb and descent.</font></p>
