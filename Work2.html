Work and Energy Transfers Between Segments</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Total work on
the lower extremity:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">On the previous
page, we calculated the work done on a thigh segment over a time period
during a walking stride. &nbsp;If we wanted to calculate the total
work done on the entire lower extremity, we would calculate the work
done on each segment by calculating the change in each segment's energy
and then add
them
together.</font></p>
<p align="left"><img src="work3.jpg" align="middle" height="175"
 width="325"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The total work
performed is 3.8 J. &nbsp;Notice that the thigh segment lost 1.7 J
of energy while the leg gained 1.5 J and the foot gained 4.0 J.
&nbsp;This means that 1.7 J of energy was transfered from the thigh
to the leg and the foot. &nbsp;an additional 3.8 J of work was
needed to move the lower extremity. &nbsp;On the previous page, we
saw that energy can be conserved by transfers within a segment and now
we see that energy can be transfered between segments.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In general, the
total work is calculated as a summation of each segment at each time
interval over the entire movement using the following formula.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The number of
time
intervals is usually the number of video frames or samples acquired in
the kinematic data collection.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Caution should
be
used with this formula when the segments include the whole body or when
a limb segment is losing energy but not able to transfer the energy to
a segment gaining energy. &nbsp;An example would be a person
lowering
one arm at the same time as they are raising the other arm.
&nbsp;The
formula above would yield a value of zero work yet in reality, negative
work is being done by the muscles lowering one arm and positive work is
being done by muscle raising the other arm. &nbsp;For this reason,
many
biomechanists do not allow transfers between segments through the trunk
unless the body is airborne.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">There is
another
method of calculating work using segmental power calculations and this
will be the topic of another lecture.</font></p>
