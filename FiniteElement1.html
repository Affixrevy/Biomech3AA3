<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A finite element
model is a computer model that describes the physical behavior of a
structure. &nbsp;The method works by first dividing the structure
into
simple parts called elements. The elements are often triangular shaped
and linked together at nodes
that creates a mesh and each connection has an elemental stiffness and
viscosity. &nbsp;Considerable computing power is required to derive
the
behavior of structures that contain hundreds or thousands of
elements
using (<a href="Forward1.html">Forward
Dynamics</a>).

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The diagram to
the left shows an FEA model of the proximal end of a human femur.
&nbsp;Bones are terrific candidates for FEA models because they are
anisotropic structures that behave quite differently than homogeneous
materials. &nbsp;Unlike homogeneous materials, bone fails first in
tension rather than compression and depending on the distribution of
trabecular and compact bone, the
response to loading and irregular shape cannot be represented by a
single stress-strain relationship. There are many applications of FEA
models in orthopedic biomechanics and the student who is interested in
this area is encouraged to read "Computational Biomechanics of the
Musculoskeletal System" edited by Ming Zhang and Yubo Fan (CRC Press,
2014).</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Before we get into FEA too far, it would be wise to
look at the <a href="Structure1.html">Method of Joints</a>
to get a better understanding of how
engineers determine the loads on the elements.</font>

<p><img src="FiniteElement1a.jpg" align="left" height="205" width="191"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Let's start
by
considering the structure shown to the left. It is anchored at point
A,&nbsp;supported by rollers at
point B, and has a 1000 N force
applied vertically downward at point C. The first step is to create a
finite element model. &nbsp;In this case, we can have a single
triangular element with nodes at points A, B, and C and truss members
connecting the three nodes. &nbsp;Each member has a length of one
meter and we are told that members have a stiffness of 50,000 N/m which
means that our structure is not a rigid body and will deform under
load. &nbsp;We are asked to determine the amount of deformation and
the reaction forces at points A and
B.&nbsp;
</font></p>


<p><img src="FiniteElement1b.jpg" align="right" height="410" width="382"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Our solution
begins by considering the structure
to be rigid and in static
equilibrium. Since the support at point B is on rollers,
the reaction
force has no horizontal component. &nbsp;In order for the structure
to be in static equilibrium, the moment about A must equal zero which
means that force at B must be 2000 N. In order for sum of the forces in
the vertical direction to equal zero, the reaction at point A must be
1000 N downward.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Now that we know
the external forces acting on the structure, we can calculate the
forces of each truss member. Engineers use the method of joints and
static equilibrium to determine the forces in each member. We will
start at node C and find the forces in the two members needed for
static equilibrium (see the figure below, left). Repeating this process
for the other two nodes yields the forces in each member that would
ensure static equilibrium of the structure.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Notice that when
we put this information together (right), the two members with 1155 N
of force are in compression and the member with 577 N of force is in
tension. &nbsp;Engineers know that most materials can withstand
greater forces in tension than in compression and could use this
information to build a structure that uses a thin cable to support the
577 N tensile force like
a suspension bridge.
</font></p>

<p><img src="FiniteElement1d.jpg" align="right" height="410" width="382"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Our solution
would
be correct if the members were rigid. &nbsp;However, we were told
that
they are not rigid and have a stiffness of 50,000 N/m which means that
compressive and tensile force will
shorten or lengthen the members and
our structure will change shape. The
deformation is equal to the force
divided by the stiffness (Hooke's law). The top member is in tension
and will increase its length by 577/50000 = 0.0115 m. The other two
members are in compression and will decrease in length by 1155/50000 =
0.0231 m. Since node A is fixed and node B is on rollers, we find the
new positions of nodes B and C using trigonometry (see the red
&nbsp;structure to the right).</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Our solution is
still not
complete because this deformed structure is no longer in static
equilibrium. Node C has changed the moment arm for the 1000 N force and
node B has changed the moment arm of the roller reaction force. The
reaction forces would now have to be 2233 N at the roller and 1233 N at
node A. Since these forces are different, we must repeat the method of
joints to yield new forces in the members.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This iterative
process continues until we converge on the final deformations and
forces that satisfy static equilibrium. In this case, the member
joining node A an B would be 0.969 m, the top member would be 1.014 m,
and the member joining nodes B and C would be 0.976 m. The reaction of
the roller would be 2323 N and at node A the
reaction force would be
1323 N downward.</font></p>


<p><img src="FiniteElement3a.jpg" align="left" height="205" width="277"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Consider the
system
of trusses joined together in the structure to the left with two
applied loads (200 N and (100 N).
&nbsp;If each member is 1 m long, we would use the same method as
before to determine the reaction forces of the roller (1000 N) and node
A (700 N). Again, we would start at the 200 N node and use the method
of joints to calculate the forces in the two members assuming static
equilibrium and work our way back to the first node.
</font></p>


<p><img src="FiniteElement3b.jpg" align="right" height="410" width="554"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">
It can be seen that some of the
trusses are loaded in tension
and some
in compression and that the loads are not shared equally.
&nbsp;If we considered the trusses not to be rigid but instead to
have
some elastic deformation based on the stiffness of each truss, we can
see that those in tension would become longer and those in compression
would become shorter. &nbsp;The deformation could be calculated and
decisions could be made regarding the required strength and stiffness
of each truss. &nbsp;The diagram below shows
the resulting
deformation if the elements are
not rigid.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Obviously, it
requires a lot of calculations to perform finite element analysis and
this becomes very computer intensive with large meshes. The smaller the
elements, the closer the FEA model reflects the actual structure but
this leads to larger meshes and more calculations. Those who
perform this analysis do not use the iterative approach shown above.
Although it is beyond the scope of this course, real FEA analysis
generates a matrix called a stress tensor which includes sizes and
stiffness of each member and</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">
they use linear algebra and the</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">
the principle of virtual work. The minimization of virtual work allows
the solution of the actual forces and deformations of the elements
without performing many iterations. &nbsp;The reaction forces at
points
A and B are called boundary conditions.
&nbsp;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Usually,
the
trusses would have visco-elasticity so there would be some time
dependence of the deformation that would be simulated using forward
dynamics.
&nbsp;Three dimensional structures and additional constraints like
constant volume may also be necessary. &nbsp;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">As such, FEA
requires sophisticated computer
software and a large amount of computing power to perform the
calculations and the resulting
simulations.</font></p>

three-dimensional human skull is shown to the right. &nbsp;The
effect of an impact could be predicted, the strengths at various points
to loads in various directions can be estimated, and it is even

cause of an injury. For a more complete explanation of how
