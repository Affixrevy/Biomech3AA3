<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> Rolling
Friction:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In biomechanics,
we
often deal with rolling objects such as bicycle wheels and pulleys in
weight machines. As with dry friction, rolling friction opposes motion
and can be an important external force. In the case of the wheel
pictured below, if we consider it to be rolling at a constant velocity,
the sum of the forces must be zero. This means that the weight (W) must
be equal to the normal force (N) and if friction exists between the
road and the wheel (F), there must be an equal pushing force (P) to
keep the wheel moving forward at a constant velocity. If there is no
friction (F=0), there is no need for a pushing force and the wheel
slides without even turning.</font></p>


<p><img src="friction7.jpg" align="middle" height="320" width="540"> </p>


<p align="left"> <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Notice that the
forces W, P, and N go through the axle but F does not. For the sum of
the moments to be zero, there must be an additional moment to keep the
wheel rolling. If there is no axle friction, then the friction force F
is
zero because the wheel will freely rotate and P is no longer needed.
Therefore, it is the axle friction that we need to calculate.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Like dry
friction,
rolling friction also depends on the amount of loading (W). Perhaps the
easiest way to understand rolling friction is imagine a deformation of
the circle as it is loaded. In the diagram below, this is shown as a
wheel sinking into the ground. The reaction force (R) acts at point B
against the vertical load (W) and the pushing force (P).</font></p>


<p><img src="friction8.jpg" align="middle" height="350" width="540"> </p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The moment
equation above indicates that the rolling friction produces a moment
that opposes rotation. The moment is due to the weight or normal force
multiplied by a moment arm (d) which is dependent on the radius of the
wheel or axle and the coefficient of friction. The table below shows
some typical values of "d" for different contacting materials. Notice
that rubber on concrete has a much higher value of "d" than steel on
steel. A bicycle tire deforms more than steel when loaded and will
deform even more if not fully inflated. This will cause greater rolling
friction and it is why many wheels use ball bearings (steel on steel)
to minimize the rolling friction in the axle.</font></p>


<p><img src="friction17.jpg" align="middle" height="318" width="907"> </p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example: What is
the pushing force required to overcome rolling friction of a bicycle
that has two wheels of 0.37m radius, a weight of 700 N (rider + bike)
and a value of d = 0.035 for rubber on concrete. Assume that the axle
friction is negligible.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Solution: Each
wheel has a weight of 350 N (700/2 = 250) and d = 0.035. Therefore the
moment of force due to rolling friction is 350(0.035) = 12.25 N.m.
Since the radius of the wheel is 0.37 m, the pushing force is P(0.37) =
12.25; so P = 12.25/0.37 = 33.1 N. Since there are two wheels, the
total pushing force is 33.1(2) = 66.2 N.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Notice that a larger diameter wheel would require less pushing as would a lower value of "d" (harder tires).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Also, notice that
the number of wheels does not influence the rolling friction. In this
case, we calculated the rolling friction of each wheel and then
multiplied by the number of wheels (2 in this case). However, we
divided the weight by the number of wheels which was also two. Since we
divide W by the number of wheels and then multiply the friction by the
number of wheels, we would get the same result if we just considered
one wheel with all of the weight. Therefore, large trucks with multiple
wheels do not have additional rolling friction and it doesn't matter if
the weight is not evenly distributed onto each wheel (assuming each
wheel has the same radius and coefficient of rolling friction).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another way to look
at rolling friction is to use the lever method to determine the moment
of force opposing rotation by rolling friction.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example: How
much
force (F) is required to raise a 500 N weight using a pulley with a
coefficient of rolling friction of 0.2?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In this case, the moving parts causing the rolling friction are in the axle.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We use the
radius of the axle
and coefficient to find d.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Then we draw
the lever and solve for the sum of the moments about B.</font></p>
