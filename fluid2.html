<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Specific
gravity is another term for density and can be defined as the weight of
an object in the air divided by the buoyant force (in fresh water). One
way to measure
the buoyant force is to take the difference between the weight of the
object in the air and the weight of the submerged object.
&nbsp;Hydrostatic weighing is a common method to determine the
density or specific gravity of the human body. &nbsp;Another method
is to use an air chamber that measures the volume of the body which can
then be converted to density by diving the volume into the whole body
mass.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The human body
is composed of various tissues of different densities such as bone, fat
and lean tissues like muscle and organs. &nbsp;Human&nbsp;body
composition is concerned with quantifying the amount of body fat as a
percentage of the total body mass. &nbsp;This has been done using a
two-component model of the human body assuming a density value of fat
and another density value for lean tissue. &nbsp;A common
assumption for the density of fat is 0.89 kg/l and 1.10 kg/l for the
lean tissues. &nbsp;If the whole body density has been determined
from hydrostatic weighing or a volume measurement, the %body fat can be
estimated using:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">While this
estimate has been considered the most valid measurement of body
composition for many years and other methods such as skinfold
measurements have been compared to it, &nbsp;it must be recognized
that
it depends on the validity of the assumed tissues densities.
&nbsp;Individuals with a higher ratio of bone to muscle mass should
have a higher value than those with a low bone to muscle mass ratio.
&nbsp;Yet the above method assumes a value of 1.10 kg/l for both.
&nbsp;Newer methods involving medical imaging like Dual X-ray
Absorptiometry (DXA) allow the measurement of bone, fat and lean tissue
more directly but it is not yet in common use for body composition.</font></p>
