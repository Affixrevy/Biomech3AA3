<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The single most
important tissue for human movement is skeletal muscle. &nbsp;It is
the
motor that acts in response to the command of the central nervous
system (CNS) and produces the forces that allow or prevent motion.

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The muscle has many fibers within a fascicle and
many fascicles within the muscle. Connective tissues (Epimysium,
Perimysium, and Endomysium) form the harness that
holds the fibers, fascicles and muscle together.</font></p>

<p><img src="Muscle18.jpg" align="right" height="408" width="700"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The muscle fiber is also called the muscle cell and
when it is viewed with a microscope, it has a striated pattern. The
pattern results because each myofibril contains sarcomeres linked
together in series with dark Z discs separating each sarcomere. Within
the sarcomere you can see the protien filaments
(actin and Myosin) which slide past each other and shorten the muscle
when it contracts (becomes active). For more information on muscle
activation, please see the electromyography lecture. &nbsp;With an
electron microscope, you can see crossbridges on the muosin filaments
that bind to actin and produce force. The sarcomere is only about 2
micometers in length.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Muscle is a unique motor with properties that need
to be understood in order
to be an effective biomechanist. &nbsp;The three component model is
a
very helpful way to look at those properties.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Three Component
Model of Muscle:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The three
components required to explain the properties of muscular contraction
include the contractile component&nbsp;as
well as the series and parallel
elastic components.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Contractile
Component (CC):</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The contractile
component is the component that actively generates force in the muscle.
&nbsp;The fundamental mechanical event is the muscle twitch which
is an
"all-or-none" event in which all of the muscle fibers within the motor
unit are activated simultaneously. The central nervous system
activates the muscle by sending&nbsp;action potentials which
release
Calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which allows actin and
myosin filaments to interact via crossbridges. the muscle does not
generate force instantaneously. The response of the muscle is described
by the force-time relation is often called the active "state of the
muscle".</font></p>

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"></span>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">(1) Force-Time
Relation:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Electro-mechanical
delay (EMD) - the time from the stimulus to the beginning of force
development. &nbsp;It takes about 10 ms for calcium to leave the
sarcoplasmic reticulum and allow binding between actin and myosin
filaments&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Contraction
Time- the time it takes the twitch to reach maximum force. This is
about 30-60 ms for fast twitch fibers and 80 to 120 ms for slow twitch
fibers</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Half Relaxation
Time - the time it takes for calcium to return to the sarcoplasmic
reticulum is exponential which makes it difficult to quantify the total
relaxation time. &nbsp;Therefore, researchers have used the time it
takes the twitch to decline to one half of the maximum force in order
to characterize the relaxation time. The half relaxation time is
approximately equal to the contraction time.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">
The CNS activates muscle with series of stimuli which summate to
produce varying amounts of force. &nbsp;It is important to realize
that muscle force is not attained immediately or stopped immediately.
&nbsp;The calcium dynamics and fiber type cause the muscle to
generate force more slowly than the fast stimuli sent from the CNS.</font></p>

Force-Length
Relation:</span></big></p>

<p><img src="Muscle6.jpg" align="right" height="424" width="524"></p>

<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Each
muscle fiber
consists of many sarcomeres linked in series that can generate force
based on the overlap of the protein filaments. The diagram to the right
shows this relationship. It is interesting that muscles in many
different animals of vastly different sizes have the same sarcomere
size. &nbsp;That is, a sarcomere length of 2.25 microns allows the
greatest force to be generated and longer muscles simply have more
sarcomeres in series.</span></big></p>

<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Optimum
length
has been called rest length in the past but one cannot assume that the
length of an inactive muscle corresponds with a sarcomere length of
2.25 microns. Indeed, sarcomeres in the middle of the fiber many be at
a different length than sarcomeres at the ends of the fiber and
different fibers may have slightly different sarcomere lengths.
&nbsp;This is known as "sarcomere dispersion" and results in a
force-length relation for the whole muscle that has an inverted "U"
shape which is different for various muscles and individuals.
</span></big></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="Muscle5.jpg" align="right" height="354" width="397"></p>

<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Another
important
consideration of the force-length relation is to recognize that the
anatomical constraints that establish the range of motion of a joint do
not allow the muscle to
be&nbsp; stretched or shortened to the extreme sarcomere
lengths greater than 3.65 microns or less than 1.05 microns.
&nbsp;Therefore, even at the extreme ranges of motion, the muscle
can always generate force. The figure on the right shows the results of
a stimulated tibialis anterior muscle over the range of motion of the
ankle joint. &nbsp;It can be seen that the muscle generated about
17N at its shortest length and increased to almost 20N at its optimum
length before declining slightly at full extension.</span></big></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="Muscle15.jpg" align="left" height="369" width="500"></p>

<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Many
muscles in
the human body utilize the ascending limb of the force-length relation
for most or all of the anatomical range. &nbsp;Leedham and Dowling
(1995) showed that the human biceps generates the most force when the
joint is fully extended and produces less force as the joint flexes and
the muscle length decreases. &nbsp;The figure to the left shows the
biceps muscle stimulated in isolation as well as the voluntary force
length relation of the elbow flexor group of muscles. It can be seen
that the biceps has a different force-length relation than other
muscles that comprise the flexor group. This has implications for the
"strength curve" discussed below.</span></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">(3)
Force-Velocity
Relation:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The speed at
which a muscle changes length&nbsp;also affects the force it can
generate. Force declines in a hyperbolic fashion relative to the
isometric force as the shortening velocity increases, eventually
reaching zero at some maximum velocity. The reverse holds true for when
the muscle is stretched &ndash; force increases above isometric
maximum, until finally reaching an absolute maximum.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">A.V. Hill's
experiments on the heat of
shortening</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">
and later work
by Huxley on the sliding filament hypothesis showed that crossbridge
attachment has a rate constant and that the faster a muscle shortens,
the fewer crossbridges are formed and force is decreased.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The reasons why
force increases above a maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MVC)
during lengthening contractions is not clearly understood but the role
of
viscous friction assists the muscle in eccentric (lengthening)
contractions and the efficiency is much higher because the load breaks
the cross-bridge attachments.</font></p>

<p align="left"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Parallel
Elastic
Component (PEC):</font></p>

<p><img src="Muscle9.jpg" align="right" height="208" width="550"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The connective
tissue within muscle and tendon have elastic properties that exert
force when they are stretched. &nbsp;We looked at this phenomenon
in
the strain energy lecture. &nbsp;Biological tissues have collagen
fibers which have a wavy pattern at rest. &nbsp;This causes a
non-linear increase in force (toe region) at the beginning of stretch
that becomes linear after the wavy portion has been
stretched straight.
&nbsp;The PEC allows force
to
be generated without muscle activation. As with all elastic structures,
the PEC stores energy when it is stretched.</font></p>

Component (SEC):</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- located
within
tendon but also cross-bridges</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- allows

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Muscle
Architecture:</font></p>

<p><img src="Muscle8.jpg" align="right" height="264" width="441"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The arrangement
of fibers within a muscle influence the force and speed of contraction.
&nbsp;In the diagram to the right,&nbsp;A is a fusiform muscle
in which the fibers run the length of the muscle. &nbsp;Pennate
muscles have shorter fibers that run at an angle between two
aponeuroses that connect to the tendon. &nbsp;Pennate muscles have
a greater cross-sectional area and can generate greater force.
&nbsp;The measurement of cross-sectional area is difficult but the
greater the number of sarcomeres in parallel, the greater the force.
&nbsp;Muscle hypertrophy via training increases the size of muscle
fibers and the number of&nbsp;protein
filaments but does not
increase the number of fibers.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="Muscle10.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="700"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The diagram to
the right shows a short thick muscle (A) and a long thin muscle (B).
&nbsp;Muscle A has twice the cross-sectional area as B and can
generate twice as much force isometrically (zero velocity).
&nbsp;Muscle B has twice as many sarcomeres in series and therefore
has twice the shortening velocity. &nbsp;Therefore, short, thick
muscles with large pennation angles are good for generating large
forces at low velocity. &nbsp;Long, thin muscles are better for
generating force at high velocity. &nbsp;The human takes advantage
of both arrangements in many synergistic muscle groups. &nbsp;For
example, the Triceps Surea group has short, bipennate Gastrocnemius and
long,
fusiform Soleus as foot plantar flexors.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Joint
Architecture:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Muscles produce
motion by exerting force and using leverage about joints. The moment of
force or torque produced by the muscle is different than the force.
&nbsp;The strength curve is the moment of force that muscles
generate at the joint and are a combination of the force-length
relation and moment arms of each synergistic muscle within the group.
&nbsp;The figure on the right shows how the moment arms of various
elbow flexor muscles change with joint angle in several subjects.
&nbsp;There is a similar trend
in each subject but the amount of
leverage can be quite different.</font></p>

<p><img src="Muscle14.jpg" align="left" height="375" width="500"></p>

<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">We saw
above that
not all muscles crossing
a joint have the same force-length relation and since different muscles
have
different moment arms, this means that the moment of force produced at
the joint as a function of joint angle is a combination of each
muscle's
force-length relation and moment arm changes.</span></big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"> This is known
as the "Strength Curve". The figure to the left shows the strength
curves of the elbow flexor group from different studies. &nbsp;The
maximum strength is at 90 degrees of elbow flexion and since the
muscles are not at optimum length, this reflects the large moment arm
at that angle. The strength curve is very important to
weight training and the design of exercises (see the "Biomechanics of
Resistance Exercise" lecture).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It is common
knowledge that the patella forms a natural pulley for the quadriceps
muscle group that increases the moment of force about the human knee
joint. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;most muscles in the human body do
not exert force in a straight line between origin and insertion.
&nbsp;The path of most muscles travels over bony prominances, other
muscles, or is re-directed by retinacula. The figure below (left) shows
how the head of the humerus keeps the moment arm of the deltoid
relatively
constant over a wide range of motion. &nbsp;Notice that the force
at the insertion (Fi) tends to shear the humerus awy from the scapula
while the force at the origin (Fo) tends to compress the scapula into
the Humerus.</font></p>

<p><img src="Muscle12.jpg" align="right" height="420" width="620"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The series
elasticity of tendon can increase the efficiency of activities such as
jumping by storing elastic energy. &nbsp;The figure to the right
shows the landing from a jump where the muscle length remains constant
in an isometric contraction while the tendon lengthens (B).
&nbsp;The stretch in the tendon stores elastic energy that can be
recovered during the push-off phase.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">This
muscle-tendon interaction allows the contractile component to contract
isometrically or even eccentrically and generate more force than would
be possible with inelastic tendons.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Two-joint
muscles can remain isometric and generate large forces during dynamic
contractions. The figure to the right shows the Rectus Femoris muscle
during a squat exercise. It can be seen that as the knee extends, so
too does the hip. &nbsp;The result is that the Rectus Femoris
remains
at the same length (isometric). &nbsp;While this may seem that it
is
not a very important muscle in the squat, it can assist strong gluteal
muscles that are extending the hip to extend the knee joint without a
large shortening velocity which would compromise force due
to the
force-velocity relation.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Muscle is a
very
unique motor with many nonlinear properties and a complex architecture
