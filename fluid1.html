Mechanics</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The following
lecture introduces some of the basic concepts of fluid mechanics that
pertain to the biomechanics of human motion.</font></p>
<p><img src="fluid2.jpg" align="right" height="600" width="520"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Buoyant Force: The
resultant of all vertical forces exerted on a body by the fluid that it
is immersed in.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Depending on how
density is distributed within the body, the center of buoyancy can have
a different location than the center of gravity. Since the
gravitational and buoyant forces are the only forces acting on a
floating object, the object will orient itself such that the two forces
have equal and opposite directions</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The magnitude of
the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced
(Achimedes Principle).</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Density = mass /
volume</font></p>
<p align="left"><img src="fluid1a.jpg" height="100" width="700"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">If an object has a
density that is greater than the density of water, it will not float.
It can only displace enough water that equals its own volume and since
the weight of the water will not be equal to its own weight, the
gravitational force will be greater than the buoyant force.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Example: How much
mass can be added to a canoe that has a mass of 50kg and a volume of
400 liters before it will sink in fresh water?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Solution: The
canoe has a density of 50/400 = 0.125 kg/liter which is much less than
water and it will float. In fact, it will only displace 50 liters of
water to achieve a buoyant force equal to its weight. As mass is added
to the canoe, the gravitational force pushes it lower in the water
until the buoyant force is equal to the gravitational force. Mass can
be added to the canoe until it displaces its entire 400 liters of water
which means that 350 kg of mass can be added to the 50 kg mass of the
canoe to equal 400 kg of displaced water.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">If we consider the
human body to be composed of muscle, fat, and lean tissue, we must also
consider the densities of each type of tissue. Fat is less dense than
water but muscle (lean tissue) and bone have greater densities than
water. A person's ability to float has nothing to do with their
swimming ability but is determined by their overall density. As
infants, humans have a large percentage of fat and float quite easily.
As we age to be young adults, the percentage of fat decreases and
muscle increases which causes an increase in density. Older adults have
less muscle and their bones have lost density as well which increases
their ability to float.</font></p>
