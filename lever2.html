of Levers</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> A first class
lever can be either a speed lever or a force lever.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Speed Lever: A
lever that has the force located closer to the fulcrum than the
resistance (i.e. the resistance has a greater moment arm).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Force Lever: A
lever that has the resistance located closer to the fulcrum than the
force (i.e. the force has a greater moment arm.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">By definition, a
second class lever is always a force lever because the force has a
mechanical advantage due to its larger moment arm. Conversely, a third
class lever is always a speed lever because the resistance moves a
greater distance in the same period of time (has a greater speed).
Therefore, levers can be used to gain either a force advantage or a
speed advantage.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Regardless of
the class of lever, the mechanical advantage is the inverse of the
speed advantage. The lever below has a mechanical advantage of four
because the moment arm of the force is four times larger than the
resistance. However, the speed advantage is 1/4 or 0.25 because the
force must travel four times as far as the resistance.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Most muscles in
the human body use third class leverage because the insertion of the
muscle causes the applied force to be closer to the fulcrum (joint
center) than the resistance (i.e. an object that is being lifted). The
biceps acting on the forearm in the previous lecture is a good example
of third class leverage. Since most of our muscles are third class
levers, we are built for speed rather than force. Our muscles do not
have to shorten by very much to produce motion but they must generate
large forces because of their small moment arms.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Here are two
examples of muscles making use of first class leverage.</font></p>
<img src="lever2.jpg" align="middle" height="400" width="550">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Classification
of levers is helpful in some cases but usually, it is more important to
examine the forces and moments of force to calculate how to make the
best usage of leverage. In the example of the shovel below, the load
or resistance is at the bottom of the shovel. However, the person can
place his hands wherever he chooses and we can classify the shovel as
either a first class or third class lever.</font></p>
<p><img src="lever5.jpg" align="right" height="400" width="290"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">If we consider
the top hand to be the fulcrum, he pulls upward with the lower hand
using third class leverage. How much force must he exert with his
lower hand to raise&nbsp;the load?</font></p>
