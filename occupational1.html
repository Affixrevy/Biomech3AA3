Biomechanics</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">One of the most
important aspects of society is employment and industry.
&nbsp;Biomechanics has much to offer in reducing injury and
increasing productivity. &nbsp;The terms Ergonomics, Human Factors
and Occupational Health and Safety have been associated with the use of
biomechanics in the work place and I will try to clarify my position on
these terms.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Confusion with
Ergonomics:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Ergonomics is
the study of people at work. &nbsp;This includes biomechanics but
also include psychology, physiology, and numerous other disciplines.
&nbsp;The same can be said for Human Factors and Occupational
Health and Safety. &nbsp;Ergo is Latin for work so Ergomechanics
would be a good name for the biomechanics component but the term
Occupational Biomechanics is also quite clear.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">History</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">I do not often
include history in my biomechanics lectures but in this case it is
important to know how the past is affecting the practice of
biomechanics in the work place today and for the future.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;Pre-1900:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Newton's laws of
motion had been known for more than 200 years but very little
biomechanics was formally being applied to the work place.
&nbsp;Most industry, manufacturing, and farming was done as a craft
industry in which the worker was a craftsman and produced the entire
product from beginning to end. &nbsp;Without electricity, people
worked during daylight hours and production was relatively slow.
&nbsp;People chose their trade based on convenience without formal
training. &nbsp;They were skilled workers taught at a young age and
didn't travel far from home.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Industrial
Revolution:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The invention of
electricity and the assembly line was a dramatic change in the way
people were selected for employment, the types of tasks that were
performed and the relationship between the worker and the product.
&nbsp;It was found that production could be increased dramatically
by having many workers performing partial steps and working in shifts
around the clock. &nbsp;A worker was only required to perform a
single task unlike the craftsman who had to perform the entire
production. &nbsp;Assembly lines were designed to optimize
production and workers were hired who could perform the separate tasks.
&nbsp;In this regard, the worker was fit to the task and was
discarded if he was injured or otherwise failed to perform at the
necessary pace. &nbsp;Conditions were not controlled by the workers
which gave rise to their organizations into trade unions.
&nbsp;Throughout this period, biomechanics was still not formally
applied to improve working conditions. &nbsp;Management tried to
increase profits without concern for worker safety and trade unions
tried to increase the worker's share of profits and other benefits
without actually changing the tasks.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Worker
Compensation and Human Rights Legislation:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the last half
of the 20th century, government agencies started compensating injured
workers and charging corporations premiums much like an insurance
policy. &nbsp;Companies with few claims had lower premiums than
companies with many claims. &nbsp;It started to become economically
important for a company to have a safer work environment.
&nbsp;Additionally, traditional policies of fitting the worker to
the task by having minimum height and weight requirements were being
challenged as violations of the rights of a job applicant.
&nbsp;The "Americans with Disabilities Act" made it necessary for
employers to make reasonable accommodations to tasks in order to not
discriminate against individuals with disabilities. The result was a
shift to designing assembly lines and
occupational tasks that fit the worker rather than the other way
around. &nbsp;Since tasks had to match human requirements and
limitations, biomechanics finally was incorporated into industry and
the field of Occupational Biomechanics was born.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A good
definition of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Occupational
Biomechanics</span> would be:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>
The examination of
human disorders and performance limitations produced or aggravated by
the mismatching of human physical capacities and the performance
requirements in industry.</big>

</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The graphic
below
shows two injury
event classifications and their outcomes.
&nbsp;While biomechanics is concerned with both, I will be
concerned more with the volitional activity type in this lecture.
&nbsp;The reasons for this are that they are more subtle and harder
to recognize by non-biomechanical engineers who are involved with
workplace design. &nbsp;Also, the number of lost worker days is
usually greater for these types of injuries.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><br>
There are no absolute standards to fit tasks to workers but there are
some guidelines that have been published based on the
&nbsp;strength differences within the average human body.
&nbsp;The list below contains limits to some common manual tasks
compiled by National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety.</font></p>
<p><img src="occupational2.jpg" align="middle" height="880" width="800">
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Pre-Employment
Screening:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Ideally,&nbsp;every
task would be modified to fit every possible worker but this is
impossible
due to the wide range of human physical capacities and limitations to
how much some
tasks can be modified. &nbsp;The employer must often make a
compromise between not unjustly denying employment to a capable
employee
and not predisposing the employee to an unacceptable risk of injury.
&nbsp;As such, a certain degree of pre-employment screening must be
done in cases where the physical demands of the job cannot be reduced
to a level that fits all people.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Consider the
following actual
court case:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><img src="occupational3.jpg" align="middle" height="1866"
 width="1000">
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The above case
illustrates the difficulty employers face and how biomechanists can
help. The meat packing company tried to avoid exposing
workers to injury by screening out potential employees who might have
difficulty performing one of the tasks. However they were found to be
in violation which might have been avoided by following these steps:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> Step 1: Perform
an analysis of the job's physical demands
before the screening is
done. This allows a more clearly written
job description and can lead to a more valid pre-employment screen (see
later
discussion on validity). &nbsp;This also allows the employer to
inform potential employees about risks and demands of the tasks
involved.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Step 2: Identify
the most onerous and greatest risk elements of each task and attempt
modifications. The biomechanist must keep in mind that any modification
must be inexpensive and easily done (satisfies the employer) and is
acceptable to workers. &nbsp;Many modifications are&nbsp;too
difficult/expensive to implement or require procedures that the
workers will not follow. &nbsp;Often, workers will not engage
safety equipment or move lighter loads more frequently even though they
know it is less risky.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Step 3:
Carefully design pre-employment screens. &nbsp;Medical exams that
involved x-rays of the lumbar spine were popular in the 1930's but were
found to be poorly related with injury. &nbsp;A medical history of
previous low back pain was a good predictor of future problems but
potential employees do not faithfully report previous problems when
applying for a new job. Fitness level has been found to be a good
predictor of injury among fire fighters but being physically fit during
a pre-employment screen is not a good indicator of future fitness
levels.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The use of
linear regression using&nbsp;weight as a predictor of strength
shows a positive relationship and it is also known that a given load is
less stressful to a stronger individual and presents less risk of
injury. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;the correlations are low (r=0.3 to
r=0.5). &nbsp;The r<sup>2</sup>
statistic indicates the explained variance which means that only 9% to
25% of the variance in strength is explained by the variance in weight.
&nbsp;Herrin (1977) used multiple regression of height, weight, and
age to explain 36% of the variance in strength but this is still weakly
valid and does not prove that smaller, older individuals cannot perform
a task or are at increased risk of injury. &nbsp;The pre-employment
task must be as identical as possible to actual tasks and even then, a
court could reject it as in the case above.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Step 4:
Establish validity of pre-employment screens. &nbsp;Equal
opportunity legislation that requires valid screens does not define
validity. &nbsp;This leaves the validity to be judged by a court
during litigation. &nbsp;However, employers can increase their
chances of withstanding court challenges by creating their own database
of scores of pre-employment tests, as well as other data from medical
exams, questionnaires, and anthropometry in order to establish risk
factors.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since each of
these steps involves matching the physical demands of occupational
tasks to physical capacities of humans, biomechanists are required to
assist employers.
