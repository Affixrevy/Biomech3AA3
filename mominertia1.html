Inertia</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Mass is the amount
of matter that an object has and it is also a tenancy to resist linear
motion. We call this tenancy to resist motion "inertia". We&nbsp;know
from kinematics that an object can have linear and angular motion. The
tenancy of a body to resist rotation or angular motion is called the
moment of inertia. The moment of inertia is based not only on the
amount of mass, but also on the way that mass is distributed relative
to the axis of rotation. To illustrate the property of moment of
inertia, consider a massless rigid body with an axis at one end and two
discrete masses located 0.25m and 0.75m from the axis.</font><img

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The moment of
inertia is calculated as the sum of each mass multiplied by the square
of the radial distance of each mass from the axis. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Find the moment of
inertia about A if each mass is 10kg.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The formula is
shown on the right. Notice that the mass that is the furthest away from
the axis has a much greater influence on the moment of inertia than the
mass that is positioned closest to the axis.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> The units are
kilogram meters squared since it is a mass times a squared distance.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The total mass of
this object is 20 kg but the moment of inertia is also influenced by
how that mass is distributed about the axis.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> If we moved the
second mass further from the axis, the total mass remains 20 kg but the
moment of inertia increases from 6.25 to 10.625.</font></p>
