  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> On the preceeding page 
    we introduced dynamic equilibrium with some simple examples in which only 
    one force was causing the acceleration and only one moment was causing the 
    angular acceleration. In reality, every segment within the human body and 
    most other objects are influenced by several forces that cause the observed 
    accelerations.</font ></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><u>Dynamic Equilibrium 
    with many forces:</u></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can calculate the internal 
    kinetics (joint reaction forces and the net joint moment) in dynamic equilibrium 
    just like we did in static equilibrium with only a few differences. The first 
    step is to draw the free body diagram. </font> </p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The FBD has all the same 
    features as in static equilibrium with the addition of the linear and angular 
    accelerations. Also, we have used the letter M to represent the net moment 
    of force caused by the tissues that cross the joint.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We could make a force table 
    as the second step but this is not really necessary. The force table was used 
    in static equilibrium to help see the rectangular components and moments. 
    However, we can now go directly to the equations and use the FBD to find the 
    components. This time, the sums of the forces are not equal to zero but they 
    are equal to the mass times the acceleration. We will also solve for the net 
    moment by summing the moments about the segment center of gravity instead 
    of the proximal joint. This is an important distinction that will be described 
    later. </font></p>

    uses a wavy line to represent acceleration. The wavy line is used so that 
    we do not confuse accelerations with the force vectors. </font></p>
