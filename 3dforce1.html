<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Until now, we have
only considered human motion to occur in two dimensions (the X-Y
plane). Although unrealistic in a general sense, many human movements
can be simplified to two dimensions and it was easier to introduce the
concepts of mechanics without the further complication of the third
dimension. We now consider human motion in space and introduce the
third (Z) direction. The first thing to consider is the axis or
coordinate system in three dimensions.</font></p>

System: </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Using your right
hand, orient your thumb, pointer and middle fingers such that each is
at 90 degrees to the others. Your thumb is considered to be pointing in
the direction of the positive X axis, your pointer finger indicates the
direction of the positive Y axis and your middle finger is pointed
toward the positive Z axis. The advantage of this is that the axis
system can be either rotated or viewed from different perspectives and
we can always find the directions. This will be seen to be particularly
useful when we consider rotations and moments of force.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Rectangular
components:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Any vector or
rigid body has three components of magnitude or length and we need
three angles to describe the direction or orientation. Consider the
force vector <u>F</u> shown to the right. The magnitude has X, Y, and
Z components and three direction cosines. The direction cosines
indicate the number of degrees that <u>F</u> must be rotated to reach
the positive axis.</font></p>
