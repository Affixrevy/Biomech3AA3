<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> In the previous
lecture we saw that muscle is a rather unique motor that develops force
that is dependent on the activation as well as its length, velocity
and&nbsp;history. &nbsp;In this lecture, we look at how the
muscles are arranged in the human musculo-skeletal system that affects
the moments of force about joint centers and also how sarcomeres are
arranged and interact with tendon properties to produce different
movement outcomes.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Muscle
Arrangement and Natural Pulleys:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It is common
knowledge that the patella forms a natural pulley for the quadriceps
muscle group that increases the moment of force about the human knee
joint. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;most muscles in the human body do
not exert force in a straight line between origin and insertion.
&nbsp;The path of most muscles travels over bony prominances, other
muscles, or is re-directed by retinacula. The figure below (left) shows
how the patella keeps the moment arm of the quadripceps relatively
constant over a wide range of motion. &nbsp;On the right, we see
that the biceps moment arm decreases as the elbow extends and then
becomes constant as the muscle bends over the bones, brachialis and
other tissues beneath it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Muscle moment arms
throughout the joint range of motion are not easily measured.
&nbsp;Medical imaging (MRI, CT, etc.) has been used as well as
models.&nbsp;</font></p>

lengths can be measured fairly easily and accurately on living human
subjects by using a cloth tape measure. If we make the simplifying
assumption that all humans have similar segment length ratios of their
whole body height, we can use the figure below.</font></font></p>
