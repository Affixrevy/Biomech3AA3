of
Instantaneous Power</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Performance in
athletic events is enhanced by the power of the athlete. Not all
activities require the same type of power and there are three separate
tests to measure the three most important types of power.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+2">Types of Power</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Aerobic Power
-
the maximum steady-state rate that an endurance athlete can convert
oxygen to mechanical work. It is usually measured by VO<sub>2</sub>
max, distance covered in a 12 minute run, etc.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Anaerobic
Power
- the maximum rate that a sprint athlete can convert CP/ATP stores to
mechanical work. It is usually measured by a 30 second Wingate test,
400 meter sprint time, etc.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">3) Instantaneous
Power - the maximum product of force and velocity that a ballistic
athlete can perform. It is usually measured by vertical jump height or
other "explosive movement tasks".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The first two
types of power are average powers and involve the calculation of work
or oxygen consumed over a finite period of time but the third type is
instantanoeous (see <a href="power1.html">Power
</a>for more details
on the difference). Another important difference is the controversy
over the use of the term "Instantaneous Power" when measureing
ballistic performance.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Adamson and
Whitney (1971) wrote: "The conclusion of this dissertation must be that
power in the strict mechanical sense, will not be a useful parameter of
impulsive muscle action. The real measure of action is the F.t impulse
itself and the manner in which co-ordinated muscle actions can generate
the largest possible impulse. There is the almost intuitive objection
that instantaneous velocity of movement of the centre of mass is not
due to the current force but to the preceeding force-time integral".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We know that
vertical jump performance and all ballistic or explosive movements are
dependent on the final velocity and, therefore, the impulse of the
movement (see <a href="impulse1.html">Impulse
</a>for more detail)
but coaches and athletes have known for a long time that aerobic and
even anaerobic power are not good predictors of ballistic performance.
Tasks like the vertical jump are better but are we using the wrong term
if we call this measure Instantaneous power or peak power?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Dowling and
Vamos
(1993) looked at many kinematic, kinetic, and temporal predictors of
vertical jump performance. &nbsp;adamson and Whitney had suggested
that
peak force, or the ratio of negative to positive impulse or even the
shape of the positive impulse phase would all be better related to jump
height than peak instatanoeus power. &nbsp;The graphs on the right
show
a typical force-time and power-time plots of a subject performing a
standard vertical jump. &nbsp;The labels refer to the various
kinematic, temporal and kinetic predictors that Dowling and Vamos
measured on dozens of jumpers of varying abilities. &nbsp;Thr
graphs on
the left show the scatterplots of peak force and peak power with jump
height. &nbsp;In spite of Adamson and Whitney's assertion, the only
predictor that had a strong relationship with jump height was peak
instantaneous power. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Since the
relationship is so strong, peak power is not a bad term to use for
ballistic performance but why is peak power so closely related to
impulse? Adamson and Whitney certainly didn't think it would be. To
answer that question, we must look at patterns of acceleration.
&nbsp;In the example shown below, two toy trains are released at
the
same time. &nbsp;The far train is allowed to roll down a straight
incline while the near train rolls down a curved path. &nbsp;The
curved
path is greater than the 45 degree incline at the beginning of the
descent but it is less than 45 degrees near the end. &nbsp;Both
trains
start from the same height, the curved path is longer than the incline
yet the train following the curved path reaches the bottom first.
&nbsp;Can you explain that?</font></p>
