<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+2">Angular momentum:</font></p>

  
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">On the previous page, we 
    defined linear momentum as the product of mass and velocity. An object can 
    also have angular or rotational momentum if it has an angular velocity. In 
    this case the angular momentum is calculated as the product of the moment 
    of inertia about the center of gravity and the angular velocity. The symbol 
    used is (L) and the units are kilogram meters squared per second.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The change in angular momentum 
    is the same as angular impulse and can also be defined as the product of torque 
    and time or the area under a torque-time curve. The units for angular momentum 
    is different than linear momentum so the two cannot be added together for 
    total momentum - they must be treated separately.</font></p>

  
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example: What is the angular 
    velocity of a figure skater who generates an angular impulse of 28 N.m.s prior 
    to starting a spin if her moment of inertia is 3.2 kg.m<sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> <font size="+2">Conservation 
    of momentum:</font></font></p>

  
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">When the sum of the external 
    forces acting on an object or system of objects is zero, the momentum of the 
    object or system of objects remains constant. On the previous page, we saw 
    that impulse was a change in momentum. If force is zero, then impulse is also 
    zero and momentum is unchanged.</font></p>

  
<p><img src="impulse10.jpg" align="middle" height="127" width="390"> </p>

  
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Even though momentum is 
    conserved, it is possible for velocity to change if mass changes. If a long 
    jumper were to carry weights in his hands, he could increase his velocity 
    in the air by releasing the weights in the air. This example of manipulating 
    velocity by altering mass may seem a bit ridiculus but it is done quite frequently 
    in rotational movements. When a figure skater spins on the ice, friction force 
    is almost zero and the angular momentum is conserved. If the skater pulls 
    her arms into her body, she reduces the moment of inertia about the long axis 
    of her body and her rotational velocity increases.</font></p>
