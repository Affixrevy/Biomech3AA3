to the Advanced Lectures</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The way we learn
follows&nbsp;stages. &nbsp;When we first desire to learn about
something that we know very little about, we require basic facts that
are exactly correct and that we can follow without question.
&nbsp;The first lectures in this biomechanics series presented
Newton's&nbsp;laws of motion and the examples and practice problems
had exact answers. &nbsp;These provide a solid base that allow us
to progress to the second stage.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The second stage
allows for the gray areas of biomechanics to be explored. &nbsp;We
are no longer constrained to the black-and-white problems and we find
that there are limits to the rules and that controversy and differences
of
opinion exist. &nbsp;We need to have an open mind, find all of the
differences of opinion and listen to each opinion or school of thought.
The lecture in Biomechanics III and Biomechanics IV will advance our
"Black and White" methods but we will also examine the inexact nature
of the data that we collect and the procedures that we use.<br>
<br>
To begin, let us remember that biomechanics is an inter-disciplinary
field of study that blends physics, anatomy, physiology, motor control,
neuroscience, mathematics, computer science, material science,
engineering, etc. It is not necessary to be an expert in all of these
fields to be a successful biomechanist but exposure to each is an
asset. &nbsp;A major theme of the advanced biomechanics lectures is
that knowledge of the kinetics of human movement is valuable to the
broad spectrum of human movement applications.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Many human
movement practitioners (coaches, therapists, prosthetists, etc.) make
qualitative observations and proceed to an assessment of what action
will improve the situation for their athlete/patient/client.
&nbsp;Since kinetics are the causes of movement, and kinetic
variables like force and power cannot be observed qualitatively, these
practitioners must make an educated guess that their remedy will
address
the kinetic cause of the movement disorder. &nbsp;Quite often,
these "educated guesses" are the result of many years of
trail-and-error experience and have extremely effective results.
&nbsp;However, it is the bias of these lectures that the ability to
determine kinetics is the preferred approach.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Measurement:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The assignment
of numbers to observed phenomena (data). &nbsp;This usually
requires some instrumentation and we will be talking about this stage
more extensively in the Laboratory portion of these lectures.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Analysis:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This is the
process of transforming the measurements into a form that could not be
measured directly. &nbsp;An example would be to take the
displacement data from a video data collection session, differentiating
twice to get acceleration and multiplying it by mass to get the forces
that caused the movement.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Assessment:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This is the
decision making step and it is the bias of these lectures that better
decisions can be made following a biomechanical analysis that yields
kinetics than directly from a qualitative observation based on
kinematics.</font></p>
