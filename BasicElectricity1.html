Law:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The current
through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential
difference (Voltage). The constant of this proportionality is the
resistance. This proportionality was discovered by German physicist
Georg Ohm in 1827 who followed the work of Alessandro Volta who
invented the first battery. Volta's work extended Luigi Galvani's work
on electricity generated by animal bodies to more general use of
chemistry to generate electricity.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Electrical
Safety:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Damage to
biological tissue is due to excessive current. We know that current
flows from a higher to lower potential and the higher the resistance,
for a given voltage, the slower the electrons flow and the lower the
current. Therefore, we would like to keep voltage low and resistance
high in order to protect against tissue damage. Individual body
chemisrty has a significant impact on how electric current affects
different individuals. The use of rubber gloves and other poor
conductors increases the resistance and decreases the current of a
given voltage. Water and even sweat decreases resistance considerably.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The alternating
current from an electrical socket is 120 V in Canada and wires are
usually covered with rubber or plastic insulation. &nbsp;Since
current
seeks the lowest potential, a ground wire (three pronged plug) allows a
path that helps to prevent the human body becoming the pathway.
&nbsp;It is also more dangerous when the current passes through the
chest from one side of the body to the other because 500 milliamps of
current can cause heart fibrillation. For this reason, it is a good
practice to use only one hand when working on live circuits of
hazardous voltage .</font></p>

consider a simple circuit that consists of a battery and a resistors in
series and in parallel. Please use the following web site and follow
