<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Mechanical
efficiency can be defined as the ratio of work done to the cost of
doing that work. In previous lectures ( <a href="work2.html">work</a>
and <a href="powerflow2.html">power</a>
)
we have examined how mechanical work can be calculated during human
movement. &nbsp;In this lecture, we will take those measures a step
further. &nbsp;The cost of doing work in human motion involves
utilizing stored energy (fat, glycogen, etc.) by burning calories and
consuming oxygen. &nbsp;This is commonly referred to as the
"metabolic cost" or "O<sub>2</sub>
cost".</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Measuring
Metabolic
Cost:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Physiologists
have
long since been able to measure the metabolic cost of human activity by
measuring the amount of oxygen consumed and converting that to Joules
of energy. The procedure involves using a mouthpiece to collect the
inspired and expired breaths of the person during an activity. By
comparing the two, the amount of oxygen consumed can be determined.
&nbsp;One liter of O<sub>2</sub>
consumed is equal to 4.83 kilocalories
assuming a respiratory quotient of 0.82 which indicates a mixed diet.
Each kcal of energy = 4.1868 kJ of energy.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example: Find
the
rate of metabolic cost for a 60 kg cyclist pedalling at 75% of his
VO<sub>2</sub>max
of 65 ml/min/kg. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
75% of VO<sub>2</sub>
= 0.75(65)(60)/60 ml/s&nbsp;= 48.75 ml/s or 0.04875
liters per second of O<sub>2</sub>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
since each liter of O<sub>2</sub>
= 4.83 kcal, consumed &nbsp;power =
0.04875(4.83) = 0.2355 kcal/s</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
since each kcal = 4.1868 kJ, consumed power = 0.2355(4186.8) = 986 J/s
or 986 W</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If the cyclist
was performing on an exercise bike set at 246 W, his efficiency would
be
246/986 x 100% = 25% efficiency. &nbsp; Efficiency can be measured
either as the ratio of work done to cost or by rate of work done to the
rate of energy consumed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Economy
of Human Motion</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The above
calculation is fine but the cyclist could also be doing work that was
not directed to the pedals of the bike. &nbsp;We have seen in
previous lectures that energy can be transferred passively between
joints and actively by muscular contractions. &nbsp;The human body
has many degrees of freedom and&nbsp;infinit ways to perform a
task. &nbsp;Therefore, &nbsp;not all performances that achieve
the same amount of external work will have same amount of internal work
done. &nbsp;We have seen that a pendulum is an example of
conservation of energy and the human leg segment during the swing phase
of walking can act like a pendulum. &nbsp;However, the same swing
could be achieved using knee extensor muscles acting concentrically to
move the limb forward and flexors acting eccentrically to stop the
swing. &nbsp;In the first situation, less internal work is required
than in the second yet the same external work was done. External work
is easily calculated by exercise bikes or weights being lifted or the
potential energy gained walking on an inclined treadmill, etc.
&nbsp;When the internal work is not calculated, it has been argued
that efficiency is not the best term to use but since in many human
activities, only the external work or power is important, it is a very
useful measure to have. &nbsp;As a result, the term "economy" has
been adopted as the ratio of external work done to metabolic cost.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Lets examine the
case of two runners with the same mass running at increasing speeds
while their oxygen consumptions are being measured.
</font></p>

<p align="left"></p>

<p><img src="efficiency3.jpg" align="middle" height="500" width="850"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">First, notice
that the rate of oxygen consumption increases linearly with the running
speed for both runners. &nbsp;We can see that
the runner B consumes less oxygen than runner A at each running speed.
&nbsp;This means that runner B has greater running economy than A.
&nbsp;However, runner A has a greater VO<sub>2</sub>max
and when running at her maximum, has a slightly faster running speed
than when B is running at her maximum. Since the objective of endurance
running events is to maintain the highest average speed, the
physiologist can advise runner B that she can increase her pace by
increasing her aerobic fitness (VO<sub>2</sub>
max). &nbsp;Runner A,
however already has a very high aerobic fitness but poor running
economy which means that there is something about the way she runs that
consumes energy that is inefficient and does not show up as external
work and running speed. The source of the inefficiency is internal and
can only be revealed by a biomechanical analysis and a measure of
muscular efficiency.</font></p>

Muscular Efficiency</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Biomechanists
use linked segment mechanics to calculate the energy or power of each
segment throughout a movement to a calculation of the total work done.
&nbsp;This total work can be considered to the the internal and
external work done and we call the ratio of this work done to cost as
"muscular efficiency".
</font></p>

<p><img src="efficiency4.jpg" align="middle" height="75" width="640"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The total work
calculated as the sums of segment energy changes is a relatively easy
calculation made from displacement and velocity measurements from video
analysis and was reviewed in the <a href="work2.html">work</a>
lecture. &nbsp;It was pointed out that the method correctly
accounted for energy transfers within segments but it also allowed some
incorrect transfers between segments.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A better method
is to total the positive and negative muscle work done using the
segmental power calculation reviewed in the <a href="powerflow2.html">power</a>
lecture. &nbsp;This method required a full kinetic analysis to
yield
joint reaction forces and net joint moments but allowed no illegal
transfers of energy between segments and quantified positive and
negative work. &nbsp;In human muscular contractions, eccentric
contractions performing negative work require less metabolic cost than
concentric contractions. It was also pointed out in that lecture that
the work of antagonist co-contractions and passive structures could not
be separated from the muscle power.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If we were to use
an EMG driven model to estimate individual muscle forces and passive
moments, we could get a better estimate of muscular efficiency.
&nbsp;However, even that method would not account for metabolic
cost of
an isometric contraction or the energy saving of utilizing elastic
energy stored in rebound movements.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Summary:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Measurement of
muscular work requires a full kinetic analysis and even with the
addition of EMG may not yield an accurate estimate of the total
muscular work. &nbsp;Economy is a very useful quantity and more
easily
measured. &nbsp;If a performance is deemed to have poor economy,
the
biomechanical causes may be difficult to identify if there is
antagonist co-contraction, isometric work, and stored elastic energy.
