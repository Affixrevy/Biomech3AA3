<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Much of what we
know about the internal kinetics of human movement has been determined
using a&nbsp;<a href="Linked1.html">rigid
linked segment analysis</a>.
&nbsp;However, we know that human segments are composed of bones
and soft tissues like muscle, fascia, skin,&nbsp;organs, etc.
&nbsp;The bones are not exactly rigid (see <a href="Bone1.html">Bone
Mechanics</a>) but they are
considerably more rigid than the soft tissues. &nbsp;How much of an
over-simplification are we making when we perform a rigid linked
segment analysis? &nbsp;That is the question that we will explore
in this lecture.</font></p>


<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Elasticity:</big></font></big></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Recall, that
elasticity is that property of an object that tends to return to a
non-deformed state after being deformed by an external force.
&nbsp;Elastic structures store strain energy which was covered in
the&nbsp;<a href="IntroEnergy3.html">Strain
Energy</a> lecture. Viscosity or
damping affects the speed of motion and
when combined with elasticity, dissipates the stored
energy. In order to understand the dynamics of deforming structures, we
need to understand visco-elasticity.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Let us first
consider a mass suspended by an elastic&nbsp; (like a spring or
rubber band) and we pull it down a distance (x) and then release it
(see
figure to the right).</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The response
will
be an undamped oscillation as shown in the graph below. The amplitude
and frequency of the oscillation depend on the amount of mass and the
stiffness of the spring. The larger the mass, the lower the frequency
and the greater the stiffness, the higher the frequency. The natural
frequency is defined as:</font></p>


<p><img src="Wobbling4.jpg" align="middle" height="60" width="500"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The undamped
oscillation occurs because the energy stored in the spring is
transferred into kinetic and potential energy as the mass rises.
&nbsp;At the top of the oscillation, all of the energy is stored
in the potential energy of the mass. &nbsp;As it falls, the
potential energy is transferred back into kinetic and strain energy.
&nbsp;At the bottom of the oscillation, all of the energy is stored
in the strain energy of the spring.</font></p>


<p><img src="Wobbling7.jpg" align="right" height="197" width="256"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Forced
Oscillation:The natural
frequency is an important frequency in engineering because if force is
applied at the same frequency as the natural frequency the amplitude of
the oscillation gets continuous larger until the material reaches its
limit of strain and breaks. A singer can shatter a wine class with her
voice if she can hold a note that has the same natural frequency as the
ringing glass.

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Visco-elasticity:</big></font></big></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In a situation
with pure elasticity, the mass will oscillate forever even without a
forced oscillation. &nbsp;However, like
friction, there is always some viscosity (often called damping) which
causes the oscillations to eventually
stop.
&nbsp;</font></p>


<p><img src="Wobbling2.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="360"></p>


<p align="left"><br>


<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
diagram to
the right shows a&nbsp;system
that is comprised of a mass, a
spring, and a damper. The viscosity of the damper reduces the amplitude
of the oscillation over time.&nbsp; </font></p>


<p><img src="Wobbling3.jpg" align="left" height="250" width="390"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The lower figure
on the left
shows the
exponential decline in amplitude of the damped oscillation. The
viscosity or damping acts like friction and opposes motion until it has
dissipated all of the energy that was stored in the spring. The
exponential decline is determined by the amount of damping. The force
across the spring is dependent on displacement (stretch) while the
force across the damper is dependent on velocity.

<p align="left"><br>


<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
amount of damping
is often called the damping ratio and a damping ratio of 1.0
is called critical damping. In the diagram to the right, we can see
that when the damping is zero (dark blue line), the oscillation is
unaffected. The green line is the response to under damping (0 - 1) and
there is an overshoot and undershoot before reaching the equilibrium
state. &nbsp;The red line is critical damping which achieves the
equilibrium state in the least time without an overshoot. &nbsp;The
light blue line is over damped and slowly achieves the equilibrium
state.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the case of a
forced oscillation, damping increases the stability of the structure
and reduces the amplitude of the forced oscillation.</font></p>

Mass:</big></font></big></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If
we consider the mass of a human limb segment
to be composed of a fairly rigid bone visco-elastically attached to
soft
tissue (muscle, skin, organs, etc.), the motion could differ
significantly from a truly rigid structure. &nbsp;Depending on the
size of the soft tissue mass, the stiffness and viscosity, the soft
tissue mass could move quite independently of the bone mass.</font>
</p>


<p><img src="Wobbling9.jpg" align="right" height="380" width="460"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Recall that one
of the assumptions that we made with our linked segment analysis was
that the CofG
within a segment did not change. &nbsp;Now consider
the motion of the CofG of segment shown to the right. &nbsp;If we
were to drop this system onto a rigid surface, the rigid mass would
have a high acceleration while the inertia of the visco-elastically
coupled mass would continue to fall and then rebound according to the
stiffness and viscosity of the spring and damper.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Let the mass of
the
rigid segment be m<sub>R</sub>
and the mass of the soft tissue be m<sub>S</sub>.
In order to solve the vertical joint reaction force (R<sub>y</sub>),
we
need to know the amount of the two masses and the independent
accelerations of the two masses.&nbsp;</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Andrews and
Dowling (2000) put accelerometers on the tibia (rigid tissue) and the
calf muscle (soft tissue) of human subjects and used
<a href="Anthropometry5.html">DXA</a>
to calculate the mass of bone and soft tissue.</font></p>


<p><img src="Wobbling11.jpg" align="right" height="525" width="400"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The graphs to
the right show that when subjects landed rigidly on a force platform
with their heel, the acceleration of the rigid mass had a peak of 22g
and the soft tissue was a bit lower at 20g. &nbsp;It was found
that
the even though the impact force was high (almost 4 times body weight),
the small difference in accelerations only resulted in a slight
difference in vertical knee joint reaction force (VKJRF).</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The wobbling
mass
issue only becomes a concern when the soft tissue
mass has a significantly different acceleration than the rigid mass. It
is mostly under impact (high acceleration) events that this occurs and
tense muscles can significantly increase the stiffness and reduce the
independence of the two accelerations.</font></p>


<p><img src="Wobbling10.jpg" align="right" height="380" width="605"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> The other
approach
would be to model the response of m<sub>S</sub>
according to assumed
values of mass, stiffness and viscosity.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Errors Caused By
Assumed Rigid Links:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Let's take an
example of a vertical ground reaction force of 1200 N, a rigid mass of
a leg/foot segment of 4.0 kg and a vertical acceleration of 20 m/s/s of
the center of mass of the segment. &nbsp;We would calculate a
reaction force of -1081 N. If a better model of the foot/leg segment
separated the wobbling mass of the soft tissue such that the bone mass
is 0.5 kg and the soft tissue is 3.5 kg and the acceleration of the
rigid mass is 20 m/s/s and the acceleration of the wobbling mass is 5
m/s/s. &nbsp;Now the equations yield a reaction force of only -1133
N.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since the
wobbling mass acceleration is lower than the rigid mass acceleration,
the joint reaction force from a rigid linked segment model is an
under-estimation of the actual forces. The figure below shows the
effects of various models on ground reaction forces.</font></p>

<p><img src="Wobbling5.jpg" align="right" height="620" width="500"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Accelerations in
Practice:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The double
differentiation of marker data requires smoothing to reduce the high
frequency noise. &nbsp;This
lowpass filtering has a similar effect
as a
mechanical mass-spring-damper system such that the segmental
accelerations may indeed be more like the composite system pictured
above. &nbsp;Another factor is the skin movement which is often
thought
to be unwanted artifact that should be better controlled.
&nbsp;Indeed,
the skin movement may cause accelerations to better reflect the
wobbling mass.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Bottom Line:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Even though the
standard inverse dynamics approach using rigid linked segment models
should theoretically under-estimate the joint reaction forces, in
practice, data smoothing and skin movement may help reduce the errors
in calculating joint reaction forces and net joint moments (albeit for
the wrong reasons).</font></p>
