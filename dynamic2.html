Equilibrium</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> On the
preceeding
page we introduced dynamic equilibrium with some simple examples in
which only one force was causing the acceleration and only one moment
was causing the angular acceleration. In reality, every segment within
the human body and most other objects are influenced by several forces
that cause the observed accelerations.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><u>Dynamic
Equilibrium with many forces:</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can calculate
the internal kinetics (joint reaction forces and the net joint moment)
in dynamic equilibrium just like we did in static equilibrium with only
a few differences. The first step is to draw the free body diagram.
&nbsp;The figure below shows the FBD that we used in the gymnast
example in the static equilibrium lecture on the left. &nbsp;On the
right is the FBD that would be required if the gymnast was not in
static equilibrium.

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The FBD has all
the same features as in static equilibrium with the addition of the
linear and angular accelerations. Also, we have used the letter M to
represent the net moment of force caused by the tissues that cross the
joint. </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The dynamic
equilibrium FBD (right) above uses a wavy line to represent
acceleration. The wavy line
is used so that we do not confuse accelerations with the force vectors</font><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We could make a
force table as the second step but this is not really necessary. The
force table was used in static equilibrium to help see the rectangular
components and moments. However, we can now go directly to the
equations and use the FBD to find the components. This time, the sums
of the forces are not equal to zero but they are equal to the mass
times the acceleration. We will also solve for the net moment by
summing the moments about the segment center of gravity instead of the
proximal joint. This is an important distinction that will be described
later. &nbsp;Finally, we need to the inertial properties of the
segment
including the moment of inertia about the CofG as well as the mass. </font></p>
