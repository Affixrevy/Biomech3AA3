<p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>I
have found it necessary to have two definitions of the biomechanics of
human motion. One definition is an operational definition that clearly
defines the field of study and serves as a guide to those of us
studying and working in the field and the other definition is a less
technical definition that is more easily understood by the lay person.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#800000" face="MS Sans Serif" size="4"><u><font color="#008000">Operational Definition</font></u>
Biomechanics of human motion is the study of the effects and control of
forces that act on and are produced by the human body.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif"> <b>The
central word is "forces" which are the fundamental causes of motion and
reminds us that we need to be concerned with kinetics (causes) as well
as kinematics (descriptions). The forces that "act on" the human body
are external forces such as gravity and the reactions of the ground and
other objects. Forces that are "produced by" the human body are
internal forces such as muscle, ligament and joint forces. The
"control" aspect to the definition reminds us that we need to be
concerned with neuromuscular control.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000" face="MS Sans Serif" size="4"><u>Lay
Definition</u></font><font color="#800000" face="MS Sans Serif" size="4">
Biomechanics of human motion is the application of the laws of physics
to improve the safety and performance of workers, athletes, and
clinical populations such as amputees, children with cerebral palsy,
and many others.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif"> <b>This
definition is more vague but it is better understood by lay people and
the inclusion of some common applications emphasizes its importance to
those who would not otherwise make the association.</b></font></p>

is Mechanics?</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="+2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Before
starting our study of biomechanics of
human motion, let's first examine the field of mechanics.
&nbsp;Mechanics is a branch of physics that studies bodies at rest
and in motion. &nbsp;The study of bodies at rest is called
"Statics" and the study of bodies in motion is called "Dynamics".
&nbsp;Many of the principles and laws of motion are more easily
understood in the static situation and we will learn these before
moving on to dynamics. &nbsp;Two other terms that are very
important to know as a student of mechanics are kinematics and
kinetics. &nbsp;Kinematic variables describe motion and include
displacement, velocity and acceleration, while kinetic variables cause
motion and include force, work, energy, power, momentum, etc.
&nbsp;The reason these terms are so important to the biomechanist
is that we use kinematics as a vehicle to get to kinetics.
&nbsp;Kinematics can be important to answer many questions in
biomechanics but it is the kinetics that cause things to happen and are
most important to understand. &nbsp;As with statics and dynamics,
we will learn kinematics before moving on to kinetics. &nbsp;The
diagram below shows this relationship more clearly.</b></font></p>

goals and objectives of
biomechanists, it is time to learn how they accomplish these. It is a
major theme
of this page that kinetics is the key. These are the variables that
"cause"
movement and while kinematics are important, kinetics are crucial. The
