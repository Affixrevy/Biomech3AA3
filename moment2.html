<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">As we know, a force vector is defined by it's
magnitude, direction, and point of application. The point of
application allows us to determine the distance from the axis to the
point of application (d). The direction of the force allows us to
determine the moment arm (MA). Since MA is the perpendicular distance
from the axis to the line of action of the force, we always have a
right angle triangle and we can use simple trigonometry to calculate
the moment arm.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Units: Since the units
of force are Newtons (N) and the units for distance are meters (m), the
units for torque or moment of force are Netwon meters (N.m).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Direction: Similar to
the rectangular components of force which have positive or negative
values in the X and Y directions, moments also have a direction. To
determine this direction, we use the "Right Hand Rule".</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Imagine that the rigid body is a single blade of a
propeller. If the propeller is struck at the point of application and
in the direction of the force, in which direction would it spin? If it
would spin in the counter-clockwise direction, this would be a positive
moment. By curling the fingers of your right hand in the direction of
the spin, your thumb would be pointing upward or out of the page which indicates a
positive moment.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">If the spin is clockwise, your fingers would curl
the other way and your thumb would be pointing downward into the page which would
indicate a negative moment. </font></p>
