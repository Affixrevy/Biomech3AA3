Equilibrium</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> The preceding
lectures have covered the kinematics that <u>describe</u> motion. In
this, and the next several lectures, we will study the kinetics that <u>cause</u>
motion. The kinetics of human motion combine kinematics with
anthropometrics and use Newton's laws of motion. There are three basic
approaches using the kinetics of human motion (dynamic equilibrium,
impulse-momentum, and work-energy-power). This lecture introduces the
dynamic equilibrium approach.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><u>Equations of
Dynamic Equilibrium:</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">When studying
statics, we considered the resulting forces and moments equal to zero.
According to Newton's second law (Force equals mass times
acceleration), if force is zero, acceleration must also be zero. In
dynamics, acceleration is most often not zero which means the three
equations of static equilibrium cannot be used. We therefore need three
new equations for dynamic equilibrium.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The sum of the
forces&nbsp;in the X direction are equal to the
mass of the object times the acceleration of the object in the X
direction.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The sum of the
forces in the Y direction are equal to the mass of the object times the
acceleration of the object in the Y direction.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The sum of the
moments is equal to the moment of inertia of the object times the
angular acceleration of the object.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Units: Mass has
units of kilograms, acceleration has the units of meters per second
squared and force has the units of Newtons. Therefore, one Newton = one
kilogram meter per second squared.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Example: What is
the acceleration if the resultant force of 98.1 N is applied to an
object with a mass of 10 kg?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The free body
diagram above uses a wavy line to represent acceleration. The wavy line
is used so that we do not confuse accelerations with the force vectors.
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Example: What is
the resultant force applied to a 23 kg object if the acceleration is
17.6 m/s/s?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In the first
example, we were told the kinetic and inertia information and we
calculated the kinematic variable (acceleration). In the second
example, we were told the kinematic and inertial information and we
calculated the kinetic variable (force). The first example is called
forward dynamics and the second example is called inverse dynamics. In
biomechanics, we usually measure the kinematics and use body segment
parameters with inverse dynamics to determine the internal forces that
caused the motion. Forward dynamics is used in simulations of sport
biomechanics.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Muscles and other
tissues that cross a joint can cause a segment to have an angular
acceleration by creating a moment of force about the joint. In the
static equilibrium section, we calculated the force of a single muscle
crossing a joint by assuming that the muscle was the only tissue
responsible for the moment. Since several muscles and other tissues
like ligaments cause moments about each joint in the human body, we
really can only calculate the net moment of all these tissues.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Example: Calculate
the moment required for an angular acceleration of 112 rad/s<sup>2</sup>
given
the moment of inertia about the elbow is 0.18 kg.m<sup>2</sup>.</font></p>
