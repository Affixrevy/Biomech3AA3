Reality is the actual phenomenon that we are trying to measure.
&nbsp;It can be a physical quantity, an emotion or attitude (in the
behavioral sciences). &nbsp;For scientists, this is the dependent
variable and our ability to measure it depends in part on our ability
to operational define it, the quality of our instruments, and our
ability to interpret the results. &nbsp;The rest of the measurement
chain addresses these issues assuming we have a solid operational
definition of the phenomenon to be measured.</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Transducers</span></big></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The first
instrument to be used is the transducer. &nbsp;In biomechanics, it
is
an instrument that transforms one form of energy to another (usually
electrical) while retaining important characteristics.
&nbsp;Examples
would include a force platform, video camera, EMG electrodes, tape
measure, etc. See
the <a href="Transducers1.html">"Properties
of Transducers Lab"</a>
for
more on
this topic.</font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The interaction
refers to an undesired altering of the phenomenon caused by the
transducer. &nbsp;In some cases, this is referred to as the
Hawthorne
effect which states that phenomena change when&nbsp;measured.
&nbsp;The behavioral sciences are very concerned that a
questionnaire
(transducer) will actually change the attitudes of people and prevent
the measurement of the real attitude. &nbsp;In biomechanics, we are
concerned with altering movement by encumbering subjects with equipment
or that subjects will move differently because they know they are being
measured or they fear the equipment.</font></p>

Conditioning</span></big></big></div>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The signal
conditioner alters the output from the transducer to match the next
element of the measurement chain. &nbsp;Quite often, the transducer
cannot measure the phenomenon directly and must be altered.
&nbsp;examples of signal conditioning could include magnification,
filtering, A/D conversion, differentiation, etc. &nbsp;See the <a
 href="SignalConditioning1.html">"Signal Conditioning
Lab"</a> for more on this topic.</font></p>

Display
Device</big></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The output
display
device can be a computer screen, oscilloscope, chart paper, etc.
&nbsp;It's purpose is to aid human observation of the phenomenon
that
was measured.

The image above is an
oscilloscope. &nbsp;If we wanted to know the amplitude and
frequency of the sinewave displayed. &nbsp;We can see that it is
about 3.5 major divisions in amplitude and the period is a bit less
than four divisions. &nbsp;It is hard to read the dials in the
picture but the 'scope was set at &nbsp;2 volts per division in
amplitude, and 0.5 milliseconds per division in time. &nbsp;Our
estimation of amplitude would be&nbsp;about 7 volts peak-to-peak
and a frequency of about 500 hz (1/0.002 seconds). There are five
divisions between each of the major divisions so our error would be to
the nearest 0.4 volts and 0.0001 seconds (&plusmn;26 hz).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Regardless of
the sensitivity of the transducer and accuracy of the signal
conditioning, the accuracy and precision of the display device can
compromise the measurement.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In the signal
conditioning lab, we saw that signals can be sent to a computer with
much higher resolution than the oscilloscope. &nbsp;This 'scope has
8 major division and 5 minor divisions which totals 40 divisions.
&nbsp;We saw in the signal conditioning that a computer usually has
4096 divisions.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The image below
is a blowup of&nbsp;the force platform signal of a vertical jump.
&nbsp;The computer display has discrete divisions or picture
elements (pixels). The computer had a resolution of less than 1 Newton,
yet the plot on the computer screen has steps of about 7.2 Newtons.
Therefore, it is important to note that the display can influence the
measurement.<img style="width: 940px; height: 507px;" alt=""

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Human
observation
refers to the interpretation and meaning that the scientist attributes
to the measurement made. &nbsp;It is important for the scientist to
avoid personal bias in the evaluation of the evidence..</font></p>
