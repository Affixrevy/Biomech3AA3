of Transducers</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A transducer is
a device that transforms one form of energy into another while
maintaining important characteristics. It is a major component of the
measurement chain because it is the device that we use to acquire
data&nbsp; (see <a href="Lab2.html">Measurement
Chain Lab</a>).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Sensitivity:</font></p>
<p><img src="Transducers1.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="300"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The sensitivity
of a transducer is the ratio of output/input. &nbsp;If we take the
example of the hand grip dynamometer pictured to the right, we can see
that the transducer measures grip strength by converting the gripping
force to an angular displacement of the needle. This particular
dynamometer has a needle that rotates 180 degrees for an applied force
of 90 kg (883 N). The sesitivity is 2 degrees per kg. &nbsp;This is
quite appropriate for adults but if we use the same transduer on
children who can only generate 10 kg of grip strength, we should use a
dynamometer with greater sensitvity. &nbsp;If we used a dynamometer
that rotated 180 degrees for an applied force of 20 kg, it would have a
sensitivity of 9 degrees per kg. &nbsp;This transducer would be too
sensitive for football players who would surely break the instrument.
&nbsp;Therefore, care should be taken to match the sensitivity of
the transducer to the phenomenon being measured.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Linearity:</font></p>
<p align="left"><img src="Transducers2.jpg" align="right" height="344"
 width="413"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If
we were to
calibrate the sensitivity of the hand grip dynamometer, we could hang
known masses and measure the angular displacement of the needle.
&nbsp;We would expect that &nbsp;the needle movement is
proportional to
the applied load but this may not be the case. &nbsp;The figure to
the
right shows a graph that might result for any transducer.
&nbsp;Known
inputs are applied to the transducer and the outputs are recorded.
&nbsp;The orange line is drawn through the measurements and we can
see
that the line is not perfectly straight. &nbsp;This means that the
transducer is not perfectly linear and the output is not directly
proportional to the input.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Repeatability
(Precision vs Accuracy):</font></p>
<p><img src="Transducers3.jpg" align="right" height="400" width="436"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Constant error
is
easier to deal with than variable error. To look at ways of dealing
with variable error and repeatability, consider the diagram to the
right. &nbsp;In each case, people attempt to throw five darts at
the
center of a dart board. &nbsp;The upper left shows very repeatable
throws indicating a precise thrower but not near the center and
therefore, not accurate. The upper right shows a result that is not
repeatable but the average of the five throws is very close to the
center. &nbsp;The bottom left is neither precise or accurate and
the bottom right is both precise and accurate.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A transducer
that is precise but not accurate has constant error that can be
subtracted. &nbsp;A transducer that is accurate but not precise
requires several measurements to average out the error.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Hysteresis:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Similar to
linearity, hysteresis uses the maximum deviation to calculate the %
error. &nbsp;In this case the deviation is from the line of
increasing input (loading) from the line of decreasing input
(unloading). &nbsp;Imagine calibrating the hand grip dynamometer by
adding weights and recording the output. &nbsp;As the weights are
taken off, you would expect the same values to be recorded as loading
but this is not always the case.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In words,
hysteresis is defined as "Output depends on the previous input".</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Frequency
Response:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to
understand the frequency response of a transducer, we will first review
the frequency domain. Up until now we have always represented
biomechanical signals and data in the time domain but every signal can
also be represented in the frequency domain.
<p><img src="Transducers5.jpg" align="right" height="371" width="390"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
The process of converting a time domain signal into the frequency
domain will be covered in more detail in the "Signal Conditioning" Lab.
&nbsp;The simple sine waves to the right has been drawn in the time
domain. &nbsp;Each sine wave
can be described by its amplitude and its frequency.
&nbsp;Signals that change direction very quickly have high
frequency components and more slowly changing signals have lower
frequency components. The units for frequency are cycles per second or
periods per second but the common term is "Hertz" (Hz).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The figure to
the right shows the bandwidths of several common biomechanical signals.
&nbsp;Voluntary human movement can be motionless (0Hz) or oscillate
at a maximum of 10Hz (saccadic eye movement can be higher).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If an impact is
included, the frequency components are higher to reflect the rapid
change. &nbsp;An example of the force platform recording of a
running stride shows the sharp impact of the foot on the ground.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Heart rate may
have a rhythm of 1Hz (60 beats per minute) but the ECG trace contains
higher frequencies for the QRS complex.</font></p>

<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><br>
The electromyogram of muscle activity has no frequency components below
about 10 Hz because motor units begin firing at that frequency. There
are also very high frequency components of the action potentials.</font></p>

<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It is essential
that a transducer has a frequency response that is compatible with the
frequency components that it is measuring. A mercury thermometer takes
several seconds to respond to a temperature but since ambient
temperatures change slowly, these thermometers have an appropriate
frequency response. &nbsp;If we try to use a bathroom scale to
measure the ground reaction forces of a running stride, the signal will
be distorted by a transducer that cannot follow the high frequency
components of the impact.</font></p>
