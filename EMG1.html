<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Electromyography
is the measurement of electrical activity of muscle. Often called EMG
for short. The central nervous system activates muscle by sending an
electrical signal along the nerve to the muscle. The muscle cell has an
excitable membrane that depolarizes and repolarizes.</font></p>
<p><img src="EMG1.jpg" align="right" height="600" width="520"></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The resting
potential of the muscle cell has the inside negative relative to the
outside. When the cell depolarizes, the inside becomes positive
relative to the outside for a short period of time and then
repolarizes. The wave propagates along the fiber and the change in
potential can be measured by electrodes. &nbsp; As the wave
propagates
along the fiber, it passes the electrodes such that each electrode
"sees" the potential slightly differently. &nbsp;The amplifier
takes
the difference between the two electrodes which eliminates ambient
noise common to both electrodes and only records the difference which
is
due to the propagating wave along the muscle fiber.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The
result is
called the motor unit action potential (MUAP). &nbsp;</font><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Each fiber
within the motor unit fires
simultaneously and is an all-or-none event that only last about 1ms in
time</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">. </font><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">When a motor
unit
becomes active, it fires at a rate of 8 to 60 per second producing a
train of pulses called the motor unit action potential train (MUAPT)</font><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">. Four MUAPs
are shown in a MUAPT on the right.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Since
the muscle is composed of
many motor units, the electrodes record action potentials from many
different motor units. &nbsp;The amplitude of each MUAP is
dependent on
the number of fibers within the motor unit and the proximity of those
fibers to the recording electrodes. &nbsp;Motor units with many
fibers
(larger motor units) or motor units with fibers close to the electrodes
have larger action potentials than others.

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Electrodes:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The figure
below show three examples of surface electrodes. &nbsp;Highly
conductive metal electrodes on the left, disposable electrodes in the
middle and a self contained pair on the right.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">It is also
possible to use indwelling electrodes from a needle or fine wire to
measure the activity of deep muscles.</font>

<p><img src="EMG2b.jpg" align="right" height="260" width="450"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Motor units
fire
independently of each other such that they have different firing rates
and they fire asynchronously. When two MUAPs arrive at the electrodes
at the same time the recording is a superposition principle which is a
summation. &nbsp;Since action potentials have positive and negative
phases, the superposition can be a subtraction when the negative phase
of one MUAP arrives at the same time as the positive of another MUAP.
&nbsp;With many motor units firing at high firing rates, the
resulting
EMG signal is a rather noisy pattern of high frequencies that looks
like the figure on the right.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Before looking
at
EMG with many motor units firing at high firing rates, let's review how
muscle using recruitment of motor units and firing rates to increase
muscular force. &nbsp;The fundamental mechanical response to an
action
potential is a twitch of force. &nbsp;Since the muscle twitch lasts
much longer than the action potential, force increases when a
subsequent action potential occur before force has relaxed.
&nbsp;This
twitch summation results with increasing the firing rate of the motor
unit. &nbsp;Muscle also develops
more force by recruiting motor units in addition to increasing the
firing rates of
those units.</font></p>
<p><img src="EMG2a.jpg" align="right" height="670" width="668"></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The diagram to
the
right shows four motor units being successively recruited and
increasing in firing rate to grade force. &nbsp;Each time a motor
unit
fires, to produces a twitch of force and an action potential.
&nbsp;The
twitch is the fundamental mechanical event of muscle contraction, and
the action potential is the fundamental electrical event. &nbsp;As
the
twitches overlap, force increases. &nbsp;Similarly, as motor unit
action potentials overlap, the EMG activity increases.
&nbsp;Therefore,
recording EMG activity is an excellent tool to measure muscular
involvement.</font></p>
