<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> Parallel Axis
Theorem:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Notice from the
Table on the previous page that the radius of gyration is smaller in
the CofG column than in either the Proximal or Distal columns. This is
due to the fact that the moment of inertia of all objects is least when
the axis is the CofG. As we attempt to rotate an object about an axis
that moves away from the CofG, the resistance to angular motion
increases. We can calculate this increase with the "Parallel Axis
Theorem".</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The above equation
states that the moment of inertia about any point (P) is equal to the
moment of inertia about the CofG plus an amount that is equal to the
mass times the square of the distance from P to CofG. If we look back
to the example of the hypothetical segment of the two masses that we
first looked at, we can see that the CofG is half way between and that
the moment of inertia about the CofG is.</font></p>
<p><img src="mominertia8.jpg" align="middle" height="570" width="500"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Often, we need to
know the moment of inertia of multi-linked segments about an axis. In
the example below we will find the moment of inertia about the hip of
the lower extremity in two different positions.</font></p>
<p><img src="mominertia9.jpg" align="middle" height="400" width="720"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Notice that the
moment of inertia of the thigh about the hip (0.5753) is less than the
foot (0.6169) even though the mass of thigh is much greater. The reason
is that the foot is further away from the hip than the thigh and the
distance is very important. In Case 2, the limb is straight and the leg
and foot have been moved even further from the axis.</font></p>
<p><img src="mominertia10.jpg" align="middle" height="380" width="720">
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">With the limb
straight, the moment of inertia about the hip is more than double that
of the bent knee. Since moment of inertia is that property of a body
that resists rotation, it is much more difficult for the hip muscles to
produce rotation of a straight leg.</font></p>
