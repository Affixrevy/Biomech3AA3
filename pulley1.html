<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> In the previous
lecture, we have seen that a lever is a simple machine that offers a
speed or force advantage. This lecture examines three more simple
machines that offer speed or force advantages.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><u>Pulleys</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A pulley is a
groved wheel that changes the direction of force applied by a rope or
cable that passes through the groove. We will only consider an ideal
pulley (frictionless) in this lecture which means that the tension in
the rope is the same on both sides of the pulley.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the example
to the right, a 100 N weight is lifted by pulling down on the rope with
100 N of force. The direction of the force has been changed but there
is neither a force or speed advantage. Since the weight pulls downward
with 100 N and the hand also pulls downward with 100 N, there must be a
200 N force acting upward on the pulley to keep it attached to the beam
(static equilibrium). &nbsp;The diagram below shows the free body
diagrams of the load (weight), hand, and pulley.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If the pulley is
attached to the load instead of the beam, the force of the hand can be
reduced to 50 N to lift the 100 N load. This situation is shown here.
The tension in the rope is reduced to 50 N and the hand has a force
advantage of two over the load. However, the hand has a speed
disadvantage in this situation because it must move through a distance
that is twice as long as the distance that the load is lifted.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Below are
examples in which pulleys are arranged to achieve force advantages of
two, three, and four. Keep in mind that the tension in the cable is
always the same on both sides of the pulley
so you can calculate the force advantage by counting
the number of ropes leading away from the load. The speed advantage is
the inverse of the force advantage just like with levers.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Exercise
machines use pulleys and cables to change the direction of force and to
allow several different exercises to use the same weight stack. </font></p>

<p><img src="pulley4.jpg" align="middle" height="338" width="400"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In the case of
leg extension, the force can be very large and pulleys can be arranged
to allow a strenuous lifting task without much weight. In the example
below, calculate the leg extension force required to lift 1000 N.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Solution:</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">This problem
involves both leverage and pulleys. The person applies a force (F) to
rotate the lever against the resistance of the tension (T) in the
cable. Since the tension in the cable must be equal to the weight in
order to lift it (T = 1000 N). The diagram of the lever is shown to the
right with the force on each pulley equal to 2T or 2000 N.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">What class is
the lever in the above example?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">If we assume
static equilibrium, what is the reaction force at the axis?</font></p>

<p><img src="pulley7a.jpg" align="middle" height="210" width="850"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Notice the very
large forces in this exercise. The feet push with 2266 N, the cable
pulls back with 5000N and the reaction at the axis pushes forward with
2734
N. &nbsp;This puts a tremendous bending moment on the lever and it
must be strong enough to not break.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The 2266 N
force
of the feet is the minimum force required. &nbsp;If the lifter were
to
exert a greater force, the load would accelerate and the tension in the
cable would be greater as well as the reaction forces. &nbsp;We
will
address that situation in the "Dynamic Equilibrium Lecture".</font>
