<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Introduction:</big>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">An important
aspect of the biomechanics of human motion is the measurement of
external forces acting on the human body. &nbsp;The most basic of
these
external forces is the ground reaction force can be resolved into three
orthogonal or rectangular components: vertical, anterior-posterior, and
medial-lateral. &nbsp;A force plate
or force platform is an instrument that is used to measure the ground
reaction forces generated by a body standing or moving across the
surface. &nbsp;The device is often placed in the floor or another
surface and is used in many biomechanics situations such as gait
analysis, sport and impact situations as well product testing and
medical diagnoses. &nbsp;A force plate is required in conjunction
with video in order to obtain joint kinetics (see
the <a href="Linked1.html">"Linked
Segment Mechanics
Lecture"</a>
).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">A force plate
is a three dimensional device. &nbsp;Although there are different
types of force plates, the basic principle of each is that transducers
are placed in the four corners that measure strain due loads placed on
the surface. The diagram to the right shows how the corner transducers
can detect the amount of force applied in three orthogonal directions.
&nbsp;Fz is the total vertical force and Fx and Fy are two
horizontal forces due to friction. &nbsp;A vertical force that is
applied to the center of the plate would produce an equal amount of
strain on each corner. &nbsp;If the force is applied at a point
other than the center, the corner transducers will register unequal
strains and the plate can measure the tendency to twist the plate about
the X and Y axes. The device therefore produces an output of the three
orthogonal forces (Fx, Fy, and Fz) as well as the three orthogonal
moments (Mx, My,
and Mz). &nbsp;For more on the three dimensional
forces and moments,&nbsp;see
the <a href="3Dforce1.html">"3-D
Lectures"</a>
.<br>
Whenever an object contacts the plate, the plate resolves that contact
into a single reaction force with a point of application. &nbsp;The
point of application is called the "center of pressure" (CP).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Center
of Pressure:</big>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In the diagram
above, the center of the force plate is indicated by the intersection
of the two red dotted lines. &nbsp;We can see that the force is
applied
at a location other than the center and if we look at the Fz component,
we can see that this off-center application tends to twist the plate
about the X and Y axes.</font></p>
<p><img src="ForcePlateLab3.jpg" align="right" height="350" width="540"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The force plate
does not measure the
center of pressure directly - it is calculated by dividing the moment
by the vertical force. The diagram to the right shows a two-dimensional
view of a force plate sunk into the floor. &nbsp;The resultant
ground reaction force (F) has a CP which is 10cm from the center of the
plate in the positive
Y direction. The force plate measures the vertical force (Fz) and the
moment of force about the X axis which is coming directly out of the
page. The horizontal component (Fy) does not contribute to Mx and Mx is
due to the vertical force times the perpendicular distance from the
center of the plate (CPy). &nbsp;For example, if Fz = 500 N and Mx
= 50 N.m, the formula on the left shows that CPy = 50/500 = 0.10m or 10
cm. Similarly, if the applied force is off center in the X direction,
the formula on the right shows how CPx is calculated from My and Fz.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In a static
position, the center of gravity of the body must be directly above the
CP. In a dynamic movement, the center of gravity is rarely directly
above the CP and the CP is continually moving.</font></p>

 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The graphs on
the left show a typical worksheet on which to plot your orthographic
vector profile. &nbsp;The data on the right show a typical output
for a walking trial. &nbsp;The forces have units of Newtons and the
moments are Newton-meters. &nbsp;The CPx has units of meters which
are
multiplied by 100 to yield centimeters for the plot.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Your
calculations involve resolving Fz and Fy into a single resultant force
vector with direction (theta) and point of application (CPx). The
figure below shows the orthographic vector profile drawn to scale with
1 cm equal to 100 N of force for the above data. &nbsp;The force
plate was set at 10 samples per second which is lower than usual so you
don't have to perform very many hand calculations. &nbsp;Typically
the sampling rate is 60 samples per second to match a video analysis or
even higher for running or other activities.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The force plate
yields a single resultant force vector applied to the plate.
&nbsp;Sometimes the clinician would like to know how the forces are
distributed within the contact area. &nbsp;In such cases, a
pressure pad is used or pressure sensors in a shoe insert are used.
&nbsp;These pressure sensors are similar to an array of tiny force
plates that measure vertical forces based on the pressure applied to a
very small area.</font></font></p>
