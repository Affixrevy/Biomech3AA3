of Resistance Exercise</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Resistance
exercise has been used for many years as a method of increasing
muscular size and strength in order to improve human capacity for work,
sport and activities of daily living. &nbsp;In this lecture, we
will look at the biomechanical aspects&nbsp;of this type of
exercise
and the
design considerations of equipment used for these purposes.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Goals of
Biomechanists Studying Resistance Exercise:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Reduction of
injury</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;Most beneficial adaptations to muscular exercise
require overloading the musculo-skeletal system. &nbsp;A balance
needs to be achieved between stressing the system enough for beneficial
adaptations and not&nbsp;stressing the system to the point of
injury. &nbsp;Additionally, many of the methods involve handling
heavy weights which is potentially dangerous and the reader is referred
to the <a href="occupational1.html">Occupational
Biomechanics</a> lecture for a more
complete
examination of the safety issues and matching the task to the physical
capacity of the worker.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Maximizing
benefits</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;Resistance exercise has been used to achieve many
different benefits. &nbsp;These benefits include increasing the
size and strength of the muscles but also stability of joints, range of
motion or flexibility, coordination, power, fatigue resistance, etc.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Contraction
types:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Isometric</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Isometric
contractions maintain a constant joint angle. &nbsp;The muscles
actually shorten at the expense of series elasticity and these
contractions require very little or no equipment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Isotonic</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Isotonic
contractions are constant force contractions. &nbsp;In most cases,
these contractions refer to lifting a weight of constant mass.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">3) Concentric</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Concentric
contractions refer to the active shortening of a muscle but in most
cases of resistance exercise, it refers to a change in joint angle in
the direction of pull of the prime movers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">4) Eccentric</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Eccentric
contractions refer to the active lengthening of a muscle but in most
cases of resistance exercise, it refers to a change in joint angle away
from the direction of pull of the prime movers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">5) Plyometric</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A
stretch-shortening cycle exercise in which the load is allowed to
increase dramatically in velocity before an active muscle decreases the
velocity to zero with a lengthening contraction (active stretch) and
remains active in a maximum effort to dramatically increase the
velocity of the load in the opposite direction with a shortening
contraction. &nbsp;Velocity and effort are important because
otherwise,
walking could be considered a plyometric exercise due to the active
lengthening prior to active shortening. &nbsp;Drop jumping, or hard
throwing of a medicine ball with a partner are good examples. The pros
and cons of this type of exercise is described in greater detail in the
"Neural Aspects" section below.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">*&nbsp;&nbsp;
It
must be pointed out the contraction types above are classified on the
basis of joint angular motion and not necessarily muscle length
changes. &nbsp;From anatomy, we know that each joint is spanned by
several muscles with different lines of action, leverage, sizes, moment
arms, lengths, fiber pennation angles ,and series elasticities.
&nbsp;Two joint muscles are also unique in the sense that they
actually
can be contracting isometrically while their single joint synergists
are
shortening or lengthening.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Resistance types:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1)
&nbsp;Free Weights (isotonic)</font></p>
<p><img src="exercise2copy.jpg" align="right" height="310" width="380"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In most cases,
lifting a weight does not provide a constant load to the prime movers.
&nbsp;In resistance exercise, the "iso" refers to a constant mass
of the weight being lifted. &nbsp;In the diagram on the right(A),
we
can see that during this elbow flexion exercise (often called a curl),
the weight has a moment arm of zero when the elbow is fully extended.
&nbsp;As the lifter flexes the elbow joint, the moment arm
increases, reaching a maximum at 90 degrees and then decreases until
full flexion at 40 degrees. &nbsp;The starting position can be
changed
by supporting the arm (B) which increases the resistance at the
beginning of the lift but decreases the resistance at the end.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another
important
consideration of isotonic exercises is that different lifters can
accelerate the load differently. &nbsp;The resistance is a
combination
of the gravitational load and the inertial load. &nbsp;If the
lifter
moves the weight very slowly, the accelerations are low and the
resistance is almost entirely gravitational. &nbsp;However, if the
lifter accelerates the load rapidly the initial resistance is
considerably larger and then is reduced to less than the gravitational
force as it decelerates near the top of the lift. &nbsp;This point
is further explained below under the "acceleration
of load" section. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Progressive
Resistance and the Strength Curve:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most weight lifters are aware that they can generate more force (move a
greater weight) at certain joint angles than at others. &nbsp;In
the
<a href="muscle1.html">Muscle
Mechanics</a>
lecture we saw that muscle can generate more force at
its optimum length and the moment arm or leverage changes with joint
angle. &nbsp;The strength curve is the combination of the
force-length
relation of muscle and the leverage changes and yields the amount of
force an individual can generate about a given joint over the movement
range.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><img src="Muscle4.jpg"
 align="right" height="250" width="475"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Muscles produce
motion by exerting force and using leverage about joints. The moment of
force or torque produced by the muscle is different than the force.
&nbsp;The strength curve is the moment of force that muscles
generate at the joint and are a combination of the force-length
relation and moment arms of each synergistic muscle within the group.
&nbsp;The figure on the right shows how the moment arms of various
elbow flexor muscles change with joint angle in several subjects.
&nbsp;There is a similar trend
in each subject but the amount of
leverage can be quite different.
Since a lifter can generate more force at certain
joint
angles, the muscles are really only overloaded at the weakest joint
angle
in a constant resistance exercise such as lifting a constant weight.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">For instance, anyone who has performed
a "bench press"
exercise
knows
that
they are weakest at the low point and as they extend their elbows, the
weight feels lighter and is easier to move. &nbsp;In order to get a
muscle overload throughout the range of motion, kinesiologists have
helped design machines that alter the resistance to better match the
strength curve. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Elasticity</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The use of
elastic bands or other flexible material is one method of increasing
the load on the muscles as the joint is moved through its range of
motion.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Leverage<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font face="Comic Sans MS"
 size="4"><img src="exercise1.jpg" align="right" height="321"
 width="605"></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The diagram
&nbsp;to the right shows a bench press
exercise that has been modified to increase the resistance applied to
the hands as the weight is lifted. &nbsp;In this case, 2nd class
leverage is used to lift the weight and as the bar is moved upward, the
point of weight application moves closer to the hands which increases
the amount of force required to lift the weight.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This has a
similar effect to elasticity and the resistance increases linearly as
the load is moved. This does not follow the strength curve exactly but
it does provide a greater overload to the muscles than isotonic
exercises.</font></font></p>

Resistance and Isokinetics:</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Machines designed to follow the strength curve using the above methods
are good in principle but not every user has the same strength curve.
&nbsp;Indeed, even for an individual lifter, the strength curve
changes
with fatigue, the speed of lifting and adapts over time. &nbsp;A
cam
that is ideal for one lifter may not be ideal for another lifter.
&nbsp;The use of isokinetics solves that problem.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font

&nbsp;
&nbsp;Hydraulic Cylinders</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><img src="exercise6.jpg"
 align="right" height="486" width="500"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Replacing a
weight stack with a hydraulic cylinder provides a different type of
resistance. &nbsp;A Hydraulic cylinder has a piston that is moved
through a cylinder filled with hydraulic fluid. &nbsp;Since the
fluid cannot be compressed, it moves through a valve at a constant
velocity. The greater the valve opening, the higher the velocity of the
movement. &nbsp;Since the velocity is constant, the resistance is
equal and opposite to the applied force by the user.
&nbsp;Therefore, as the lifter moves through the range of movement
and exerts greater force at the stronger points on the strength curve,
the machine accommodates its resistance accordingly.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font

&nbsp; Pneumatic Cylinders</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Pneumatic
cylinders are similar to hydraulic cylinders but they are filled with
air instead of hydraulic fluid. &nbsp;These cylinders are less

Electromechanical Motors</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Popular in the
therapeutic clinics are the uses of isokinetic dynomometers that are
driven by electromechanical motors. &nbsp;Similar to hydraulic
cylinders, these machines move at a constant velocity which means that
they do not accelerate and, therefore, accommodate the resistance to
the
applied force by the user. &nbsp;These devices are quite expensive
and
generally have computer control and measurement of applied force.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Free Weights
versus
Machines:</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Lifting free
weights as a training stimulus has been used for many years but there
has always been a safety issue of dropping heavy weights.
&nbsp;Early
machines attempted to solve the problem by isolating the weight stack
away from the lifter using cables or levers. &nbsp;An added benefit
of
machines was the aspect of isolating the target muscle group of each
exercise by designing exercise specific machines to eliminate the
problem of improper technique. &nbsp;However, many of these
exercises
involved only a single segment and eliminated involvement of
stabilizing muscles. &nbsp;These exercises violate the principal of
exercise specificity (see <a href="specificity1.html">Exercise
Specificity
</a>). &nbsp;Often strength
gains
achieved
in the weight
room are much greater than performance gains in the activity.
&nbsp;The
principle of exercise specificity requires the exercise to mimic the
skill as closely as possible for the greatest transfer to occur.
&nbsp;In this regard, free weights allow greater flexibility in
exercise design that can involve multi-segment movements and
stabilizing
muscles similar to actual sport skills. &nbsp;Machines that use
pulleys
with friction or isokinetics have eccentric loads that are less than
concentric or no eccentric loading at all. &nbsp;Free weights have
an
eccentric load that is the same as the concentric load and since muscle
is stronger during lengthening this is a better overload situation. It
should be pointed out that lifters who are only concerned with muscle
size (body builders) are less concerned with specificity but acutely
aware of the role of eccentric loading and fatigue to achieve maximum
results. &nbsp;For this population, the use of free weights and a
spotter is very effective.</font></font></p>

 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The figure
above
shows a 6 repetition lift of a 800N weight&nbsp;at two different
frequencies. Lifting the weight slowly (left) took about 40 seconds to
achieve the 6 repetitions. &nbsp;It can be seen that the required
force exceeds 800N as the weight is decelerated in the downward
direction and accelerated in the upward direction. &nbsp;Similarly,
the forces are less than 800N as the weight is decelerated in the
upward direction and accelerated in the downward direction. Lifting the
weight quickly (right) shows much greater forces. &nbsp;Therefore,
the resistance is dependent on the acceleration of the load and tasks
that appear equal can be quite different.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Many believe
that the best results are achieved by lifting very heavy weights slowly
and with very few repetitions. They argue that lifting weights quickly
is a risk of injury and achieves lower results. &nbsp;They believe
that lifting more weight not only provides greater strength but also
faster movements. &nbsp;They use Newton's second law to show that
an increase in force causes an increase in acceleration which is an
increase in the rate of change of velocity. &nbsp;Therefore,
stronger muscles allow greater speed and athletes do not have to lift
faster to become faster. &nbsp;But is this really true?</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Wrbaskic and
Dowling (2006) measured isometric strength and elbow extension velocity
of 32 subjects. &nbsp;The figure on the right shows the subjects
ranked
from strongest to weakest on the left side and fastest to slowest on
the right. &nbsp;If the strongest athlete was the fastest, there
would
be a direct mapping
yet the crossing lines show quite clearly that
strongest is not necessarily the fastest.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Many believe
that
muscle&nbsp;is stimulated to become larger and stronger as a
response
to lifting a weight repeatedly until additional repetitions are
impossible ("going to failure"). Fatigue is a great motivator and it is
common to see higher values of EMG with fatigue than individuals can
attain during a single maximum contraction. &nbsp;For this reason,
many weight lifting programs use multiple sets and repetitions. It is
also advised to lower the last repetition as slowly as possible to take
advantage of the increased strength of the eccentric contraction and
maximize the fatigue of the exercise. </font></font></p>
