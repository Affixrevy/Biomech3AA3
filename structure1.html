<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">When we examined the mechanical properties of bone,
it was stated that bone fails first in tension but materials like
metals (steel. alluminum, etc) or plastic can withstand much more
stress in tension than in compression. This may seem like a
contradiction but really it has more to do with how a structure can
behave differently than a material even if the structure is constructed
from that material, In a structure, the material is organized in such a
way to obtain the desired mechanical behavior. The </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">image to the right
shows a model of the
trabeculae in a section of bone. We can see that the structure of bone
is a network of connected trusses</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">. In order to
understand the behavior of the structure we need to know the stress
placed on each truss. We cannot simply assume that if we place the
structure in compression that each truss will have an equal load or an
equal stress.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Quite often in
engineering, an object is a structure composed of rigid links and it is
necessary to know all of the forces on each link. A link is called a
"truss" and the forces are determined using the method of joints. In
biomechanics, we do not use this method as much as civil engineers
designing bridges but a basic understanding is useful for more advanced
topics such as bone modeling and finite element modeling that is
becoming an important part of biomechanics.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Let us look at a typical engineering problem in
which we need to know the compression and tension forces on each truss
of the bridge shown below. The bridge is a structure made of seven
trusses: AB, AC, BC, BD, CD, CE, and DE.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Step !: Find the external forces R<sub>A</sub>
and R<sub>E</sub>. We can use the sum of the moments about
E to find R<sub>A</sub> and then the sum of the forces in
the Y direction to find R<sub>E</sub>.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Step 2: Draw free body diagrams of each joint and
choose the joint with the lowest number of
unknown forces acting on it to start solving the truss forces.</font></p>

<p><img src="Static17.jpg" align="middle" height="380" width="580"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Joints A and E have 2 unknown forces, joints B and
D have 3 unknown forces and joint C has four unknown forces. We will
start with joint A and use the method of joints to solve for forces AB
and AC. Since AC is horizontal, the vertical component of AB must
balance the 14000 N force. We use the sum of the forces in the vertical
(Y) direction to find AB and then we can use the sum of the forces in
the horizontal direction to find force AC.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Similarly we can do
the same thing for joint E to solve the forces DE and CE. Since CE is
horizontal, the vertical component of DE must
balance the 18000 N force. We use the sum of the forces in the vertical
(Y) direction to find DE and then we can use the sum of the forces in
the horizontal direction to find force CE.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Now that we know force AB = 16166 N, we can examine
joint B and determine the forces BC and BD. Since BD is horizontal, We
can sum the vertical forces to find force BC, We can then sum the
horizontal forces to find force BD.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">And now that we know force DE = 20785 N, we can
examine
joint D and determine the last remaining force CD.&nbsp;We
can sum the vertical forces to find force&nbsp;CD.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We have now found
the forces in all seven trusses and we don't need to examine joint C.
However, it is a good idea to use joint C as a check to see that it is
indeed in static equilibrium and that we have not made a mistake.</font></p>

<p><img src="Structure2.jpg" align="right" height="380" width="580"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The forces in the trusses are:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">AB = 16170 N compression</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">AC = 8080 N tension</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">DE = 20800 N compression</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">CE = 10390 N tension</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">BC = 11550 N tension</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">BD = 13860 N compression</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">CD = 6930 N tension</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Notice that some of
the trusses have compression loads and others are loaded in tension.
This may be surprising because we might assume that all of the elements
are loaded in compression as gravity pulls the bridge down against the
resistance of its supports. But this is not the case and without the
method of joints, we might have a structure that behaves much
differently from what we would expect and we wouldn't know why.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If this bridge was
made of steel, and we know that steel can withstand larger forces in
tension than in compression, we could use this information to choose
the size of the trusses needed to withstand the loads. For instance,
trusses BC, and CD are in tension, have relatively small loads and
could be replaced with thinner cables. Conversely, AB, BD, and DE have
large compressive loads and would require strong, thick beams.</font></p>
