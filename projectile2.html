an arrow at an angle of 20 degrees above horizontal at a target that is
60 meters away.</font> <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> Find the

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Step 1: The first
step in every projectile problem is to write the equations of motion.</font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Since gravity is
the only force acting on the subject, the acceleration in the y
direction is -9.81 m/s/s and the acceleration in the x direction is 0
m/s/s. We use integral calculus to yield the velocity and displacement
equations.</font> </p>

substitute the given information of this particular problem.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Step 3: This is
the most difficult step because we must look at our six equations of
motion and decide which one or ones will help us find the answer to the
question that we have been asked. In this case we have been asked to
find the velocity (V). If we knew the time in the air, it would make
the problem easier. Since we don't know either time or velocity, we
have two unlnowns and we must use two equations to solve them. We know
the horizontal and vertical position required for a bullseye to be 60
meters and 1.0 meters, respectively so we will use equations [3] and
[6].</font> </p>
