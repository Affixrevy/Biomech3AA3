Analysis of Human Movement</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to analyze
human movement quantitatively, we must measure human movement.
&nbsp;There are many different methods used in biomechanics to
perform
motion capture. &nbsp;For a closer examination of these methods see
the&nbsp;<a href="DataCollection1.html">"Motion
Capture"</a> lecture.
The most common method of measuring human movement is to use
film or video recordings with a method called "motion
capture".&nbsp;This lab presents the steps required to produce a
video
tape or film that can be quantified and the typical method of making
the measurements.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>The
Biomechanical Film or Video:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">There are only two
variables that can be measured by a video or film analysis.
&nbsp;These
two variables are position and time. &nbsp;However, if we are
careful
about how we produce the video, we can derive many other variables
such as joint angles, velocities, accelerations, centers of mass, etc.
&nbsp;The following is a list of requirements:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Camera Placement:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A single camera
limits the biomechanist to a planar analysis. &nbsp;So the camera
must
be placed perpendicular to the plane of motion.<br>

The camera should be stationary so that any motion from one frame to
the next would be due to the&nbsp;movement of the subject.
&nbsp;Quite
often, the camera is placed on a tripod and leveled so that the
vertical axis will be in line with gravity and the height of the camera
is at the middle of the frame. &nbsp;Since the camera cannot zoom
in or
out during filming, it must be paced far enough away so as to "see" the
required frame in its entirety. &nbsp;There are methods of using a
panning or moving camera but they require a calibrated background such
that the position and orientation of the camera can be calculated for
each frame.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Body segment
landmarks are normally placed on the subject in a biomechanical
analysis so
that joint centers can be digitized more easily. Often, the markers are
reflective tape so when a spot light is shined on the subject, the
video shows bright lights at each marker that is really the reflected
light from the spot light.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">3) The image needs
to be scaled to life size using an object of known size in the plane of
motion. &nbsp;Often, a meter stick or calibrated object of known
size
is placed in the field of view <span style="font-weight: bold;">and
in the plane of motion</span>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">4) Exact timing
information of frame rate is needed to establish velocity and
acceleration. &nbsp;A falling object in the
background was used in the old days but this was replaced by light
emitting diodes within the cameras and the quartz technology used in
modern watches ensures exact precise frame rate in today's video
cameras.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Basic
Photography for Biomechanists</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Whether the image
to be analyzed is from a still or video camera, there are some basic
rules and techniques that every biomechanist should know in order to
obtain a clear, high quality image.</font></p>

<p><img src="DataCollection2b.jpg" align="right" height="226" width="900"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Aperture and
Exposure Time:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Aperture refers to
the size of opening that the lens uses to allow light expose film or
reach the CCD of a digital camera. &nbsp;It is measured in f-stops
with
the larger numbers (settings) being used when a lot of light is present
and lower numbers are used in low light situations. &nbsp;For
example
F8 is often used outdoors in sunlight while F2.8 or lower is often used
indoors with room lighting. Another factor that affects the
amount of light that hits the film or CCD is the exposure time which is
regulated by the shutter speed. &nbsp;The shutter opens to the set
aperture for a period of time and then closes. &nbsp;In
biomechanics,
this exposure time is measured in a fraction of a second. &nbsp;The
scientist must choose a time that is sufficiently short to prevent
motion blur yet sufficiently long to get a proper exposure.
&nbsp;If
the&nbsp;time is too short, the image will be under exposed and be
too
dark. &nbsp; Therefore, it is important to choose the best aperture
and exposure time to yield an image that is sufficiently bright without
motion blur. &nbsp;Still photography often uses a flash to increase
the
amount of light such that a short exposure time can be used and in
video, extra lights such as flood lights or TV lights are used.
&nbsp;A
shutter speed of 1/100th of a second is often sufficient for walking
and slower movements while 1/500th or higher is often used for more
dynamic movements. &nbsp;The biomechanist first considers the
motion to
be captured and selects the shutter speed required. &nbsp;Then
using a
light meter, selects an aperture that will allow a proper exposure.
&nbsp;If there is not enough light, extra light must be used or the
ISO
can be altered.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Depth of Field (DOF):</font></p>

<p><img src="Photography3.jpg" align="left" height="396" width="599"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The depth of field refers to the range of distances
from the camera that will be in focus. Objects that are closer or
further away from this range will not be in focus. Notice in the figure
to the left that the white chess pieces are in focus. However, if light
was low and the photographer needed to open the aperture to f/2, the
depth of field is small and the black chess pieces are not in focus.
The depth of field is quite small at f/2 which means that only a narrow
range of objects will be in focus. If more light is available, and an
aperture of f/16 can be used, both the white and black pieces are in
focus because the depth of field is larger. The biomechanist must be
careful to ensure that all objects that need to be digitized are in
focus. It is possible for the right arm to be in focus but the left arm
is not in focus of a sagittal plane image like the baseball player
above.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">ISO:</font></p>

<p><img src="Photography2.jpg" align="left" height="331" width="499"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The ISO is another
way to alter the exposure. &nbsp;It increases the sensitivity of
the
CCD to light. &nbsp;A typical value of 100 is used but if the
biomechanist finds that the movement requires a shutter speed of 1/500
and the largest aperture of the lens is f/4.0 which does not allow
enough
light, the ISO can be increased to 400 which allows the available light
to make a brighter image. &nbsp;Modern still cameras allow ISO
settings
of 6400 or even higher which enables fast shutter settings in low light
but the image quality becomes noisy or grainy so care should be taken
when using ISO as a means to deal with low light. The added benefit of
using a supplementary light source like a flash or spot light near the
camera is that it tends to fill in shadows that might obscure a joint
marker even if the overall image is properly exposed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Auto Focus:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The other crucial
aspect to image quality is the sharpness of the image. &nbsp;Since
biomechanical filming is concerned with the plane of motion, the
subject is always the same distance from the camera and focus does not
need to change. &nbsp;Therefore, the auto focus function should be
turned off so the camera does not get confused by anything moving in
the background or foreground.</font></p>

<br>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Focal Length (Zoom):</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The focal length is
also an important consideration. Most people are familiar with a zoom
lens that allows a closer view of the subject but this also has
complications. The focal length is measured in millimeters with a focal
length of 80mm being approximately equal to the view from a human eye.
A wide angle lens (&lt;50 mm) increases distortion called the
"barrel
effect" which can be quite extreme (think of a "fish-eye" lens or the
security peep hole in a door). A longer lens (&gt; 200mm) has less
distortion but is harder to hold steady and requires a high shutter
speed to prevent motion blur from an unsteady hand. Modern lens
technology uses "image stabilization" to reduce this problem but
biomechanics places the camera on a fixed tripod and does not suffer
from this limitation. Often, a longer lens cannot handle apertures
larger than f/4.0 which also means more light or a higher ISO is
required. However, since perspective distortion is less, a flatter
image (long focal length) is
preferred in biomechanics.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Bottom Line:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The more light you
have, the greater freedom you have to choose aperture, exposure time,
ISO, depth of field and focal length. The laboratory setting usually
allows extra light from spot lights to be used but many field settings
do not and the biomechanist must be prepared to manipulate all of these
factors to get the best&nbsp;image possible.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Procedure:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Attach the camera to the tripod.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Position the
camera&nbsp;3.2 meters from the force platform and attach the
24-105mm zoom
lens and set the f-stop to 4.0 and the ISO to 100.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">3) Place two meter sticks on either side of the
force plate and focus the camera on the near stick, set the shutter
speed at 1/13 and take a picture.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">4) Move the camera back to the 10 m mark and zoom
to about a 100 mm focal length (same view as before) and take another
picture.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">What effect did the change in focal length have on
perspective error?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">5) Have a subject stand on the force platform and
swing their arms rapidly while a picture is taken.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">6) Increase the ISO to 400, 1600 and 6400 and
adjust the shutter speed to keep the exposure the same.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">What effect did shutter speed have on motion blur?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Compare the noise of 6400 ISO with 100 ISO.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">7) Place the camera at 8 m and replace the lens
with the 50 mm prime lens. Set the f-stop to 1.8 and the shutter speed
at 1/80 and ISO of 100.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">8} Have the subject swing their arms again and add
the light and increase ISO to get an acceptable exposure with no motion
blur or noise.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">9) Change the image size to video resolution and
take one more picture.</font></p>
