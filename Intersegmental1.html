Dynamics</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the previous
lecture "<a href="Forward1">Forward Dynamics and Computer Simulation</a>",
we saw that angular acceleration of segment 1 was influenced not only
by the net joint moment at the proximal joint, but also the net joint
moment at the distal end, the angular velocity of the second segment,
the joint angle and the inertial charagteristics of the second segment.

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A system of two
segments controlled by M<sub>1</sub>
and M<sub>2</sub>
is more complicated.&nbsp; The angular acceleration of segment 1 is
effected by more than just M<sub>1</sub>.
&nbsp;There are two equations
which can be solved to yield the two angular accelerations.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Example: Find
the shear force and bending moment given: F = 100 N, L = 0.7 m, l = 0.4
m</font></p>

<p align="left"></p>

<p><img src="bone5a.jpg" align="middle" height="600" width="750"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The sheer force
is 57.1
N and the bending moment is 17.14 N.m. &nbsp;The beam will
fail
because of the bending moment, not the sheer force.
&nbsp;Therefore,
the strength of the beam depends on its ability to withstand bending
stress.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Bending Stress
and
the
Area Moment of Inertia:</font></p>

<p><img src="bone6.jpg" align="middle" height="580" width="940"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Bones are not
rectangular beams but their shape has an effect on the stress and the
loading direction. &nbsp;The shape of bones is governed by needed
attachment points for muscles and skeletal strength in the face of
typical loading activities. &nbsp;Bones also house the marrow
necessary for red blood cell production which requires them to be
hollowed. &nbsp;Does this loss of bone material inside cause a
decrease in bone strength?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">How Much Weaker
are Hollow Bones?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">To examine this
issue, we will consider the bone to be a circular rod. &nbsp;In the
example below, Bone A is a solid rod with a diameter of 2.0 cm (radius
= 1.0 cm). &nbsp;Bone B also has a diameter of 2.0 cm but a 1.0 cm
diameter section has been removed from the center.</font></p>

<p><img src="bone7.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="750"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The hollow bone
has a lower area moment of inertia with the same value for C which
means that it will experience greater stress for the same bending
moment. &nbsp;However, it also has less mass since material was
removed from the center. &nbsp;If we were to add the mass removed
from the center to the outside so the two bones had the same mass, we
would increase the area moment of inertia and also increase C.
&nbsp;In this case, the mass from the center increases the radius
to 1.118 cm.
</font></p>

<p><img src="bone8.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="750"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Therefore,
hollow bones are actually stronger than solid bones of the same mass.
&nbsp;This is why bicycle frames are made of tubes rather than
solid rods. &nbsp;Ultimate bending stress of human cortical bone
has been found to be about 208 N/mm<sup>2</sup>.
If a bone had a
diaphysis (shaft) of 20 cm in length, an area moment of inertia of
1.178 cm<sup>4</sup>,
and a center distance of 1.118 cm, it could
withstand a bending moment of 20800(1.178)/1.118 = 21900 N.cm or 219
N.m. &nbsp;If a load was placed half way between two supports 20 cm
apart, the shear force would be 2190 N and the load would be 4380 N.
&nbsp;If the bone was solid, the bending moment would only be 163.3
N.m
and it could only withstand a load of 3266 N.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">As mentioned
earlier, bone loading is often a combination of loading types and
bending strength is not the only concern. &nbsp;If the hallow gets
too
large and the shell too thin, the bone strength is compromised for
impact or shear strength. &nbsp;Birds have bones that are more
hollow
because mass is a greater concern than strength for flight.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Fatigue
Fracture:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Repeated
loading at strains below the ultimate strength can still cause failure
in any material if the frequency and number of repetitions is high
enough. &nbsp;A common experience is to bend a coat hanger back and
forth until it breaks into two pieces. &nbsp;Fatigue microdamage is
responsible for this type of failure. &nbsp;Running and skiing
injuries
involving bone fracture often occur after a long session of activity
and the microdamage may be a contributing factor. &nbsp;However, it
may
also be due to muscular fatigue because the muscles play a role in
reducing bone stress. &nbsp;Muscles crossing human joints produce
moments of force but they also produce compressive forces. &nbsp;As
we
have seen, a bending moment places one side in tension and the other in
compression. &nbsp;Since bone fails first in tension, the
compressive
muscle forces reduce the tension caused by bending.
&nbsp;Therefore, it
could be the loss of muscle force due to fatigue that does not provide
sufficient protection to a bending moment that causes the fracture.
&nbsp;A skiing fall late in the day may result in more damage than
a
similar fall earlier in the day due more to muscular fatigue than to
microdamage in the bone itself.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Unlike
artificial
materials, bone is self repairing and the microdamage caused by
repetitive loading is of less concern because over time, the bone can
remodel and repair the microdamage. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Bone Remodeling:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Bone can adapt
by
changing its size, shape, and composition. &nbsp;Modeling refers to
the
rapid changes in size and shape during development and is greatly
reduced in adult bone. &nbsp;The mechanical properties of the bone
material are matched to mechanical loads by remodeling. &nbsp;That
is,
the material properties are changed rather than the bone geometry.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Three Rules for
Bone Adaptation to Mechanical Stimuli:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">1) Bone
adaptation
is driven by dynamic rather than static loading. &nbsp;Strain is
important and explains why gymnasts have greater bone density than
swimmers. &nbsp;Plyometric exercise may be particularly beneficial.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">2) Only a short
duration of mechanical loading is necessary to initiate an adaptive
response. &nbsp;Long periods have diminishing returns.
&nbsp;Bone mass
(as a percent of controls) = 100 + 11 log(1 + N) where N is the number
of cycles per day.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">3) Bone cells
accommodate to a customary mechanical loading environment.
&nbsp;They
are less responsive to routine loading signals.</font></p>
