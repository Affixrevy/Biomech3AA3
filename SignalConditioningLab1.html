<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">As mentioned in
the&nbsp;<a href="MeasurementChainLab1.html">Measurement
Chain Lab</a>, th</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">e
measurement chain has a step called "Signal Conditioning". &nbsp;It
was stated there that signal conditioning modified the output of the
transducer to match the output display device. &nbsp;</font><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;Sometimes
the modification is
simply an amplification such as increasing the EMG voltage so muscle
activity can be displayed on a pen recorder. &nbsp;Since today's
methods use
computers for most calculations and even the display of signals, the
conversion of&nbsp;the electrical output of the transducer to a
digital
file of numbers is one of the most common signal modifications and this
will be covered in the first section. In biomechanics, we often want
information that is not measured directly by the transducer such
as velocity from video data or impulse from a force platform and the
way
we get the computer to differentiate and integrate will be covered in
subsequent sections. &nbsp;Finally, it is important to realize that
biomechanical signals have noise and often require filtering to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio and this topic will covered in the "frequency
domain processing" section</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">.

to
Digital Conversion:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><br>
</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The output of
biomechanical
transducers is a continuous electrical signal called an analog signal.
&nbsp;In the early days of biomechanics, analog&nbsp;signals
from EMG,
force plate, elgons, etc. were amplified and displayed on
oscilloscopes.
&nbsp;Analog circuits were designed to perform these modifications
and
it
was even possible to differentiate and integrate the signals with
analog devices. &nbsp;Today, most signal conditioning and display
is
performed by a digital computer and requires the analog signal to be
converted to a digital file of numbers.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"
 size="4">&nbsp;Therefore,
a crucial step in signal processing is to
convert the analog signal to a digital signal. &nbsp;This process
is often called A/D conversion (pronounced A to D conversion).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In essence, an
A/D converter acts like a very fast digital voltmeter. &nbsp;It
captures the voltage at an instant in time, converts it to a number and
stores it in a computer file. &nbsp;In a way, it is like a movie
camera capturing an image frame and storing it on film. &nbsp;Since
the A/D converter can only make measurements at discrete times, all of
the information between the sample times is lost.
&nbsp;Fortunately, computers are very fast and A/D converters can
sample signals at very high rates to closely approximate the original
continuous analog signal.</font></p>
<p><img src="SignalConditioningLab2.jpg" align="right" height="509"
 width="659"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The resolution
of the
measurement depends on the number of binary decisions that the A/D
converter can make. &nbsp;Computers are binary machines and every
decision
requires a single piece of information (1 bit).
For example, let us consider an
A/D converter that can measure voltages between zero and 10 volts.
&nbsp;The first bit of information would tell the computer that the
data sample
is less than or greater than 5 volts. &nbsp;Once the
computer knows this, a second bit would divide voltage again into four
categories 0-2.5, 2.5-5.0, 5.0-7.5, and 7.5-10.0 volts. A third bit of
information would create 8 categories and so on. &nbsp;For this
reason, the resolution of an A/D converter is a binary number
represented by 2<sup>n</sup>.
&nbsp;A 12 bit A/D converter would have 2<sup>12</sup>
= 4096 categories.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Force
Platform Example:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The output from
a force platform is an electrical signal that is proportional to the
force applied to it. &nbsp;Let us assume that we want to send the
vertical force data of a person performing a vertical jump into a
computer for further analysis.</font></p>
<p><img src="SignalConditioningLab3.jpg" align="left" height="413"
 width="720"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This
graph is a computer plot of the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
magnification or gain of the amplifier was set such that 2000 N of
force was equal to 10 volts. &nbsp;Therefore, the sensitivity of
the
force platform was 200N/volt. </font><font face="Comic Sans MS"
 size="4">&nbsp;A 12
bit A/D converter was used
to sample the analog output from the force platform </font><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">and the
resolution of the A/D converter
was 4096 units from -10 to +10 volts. &nbsp;An A/D unit of 1
corresponded to -10 volts and an A/D unit of 4096 corresponded to +10
volts. Since the output of the force plate was composed of positive
voltages, only the upper half of the A/D converter was used.
&nbsp;Also
note that the impact forces of landing exceeded the 10 volt maximum
range of the A/D converter and topped out. &nbsp;In this case, the
investigators were only concerned with the take-off phase but if the
impact forces of landing were important, they would need to reduce the
amplification and sensitivity of the force platform to capture these
larger forces. &nbsp;Since 2048 A/D units equal 10 volts and 2000
N,
each A/D unit =
2000/2048 = 0.977 N. &nbsp;The fine ticks represent 1/10th of a
volt
which means there are over 20 A/D units between each fine tick on the
graph which is very high resolution.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
figure below is a blow up and shows the resolution of the computer
screen to be much lower than the digitized data. The resolution of the
computer screen has about 5 Newtons for each pixel which less than a
fifth of the resolution of the measured data.</span></big></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><big><big><span
 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The Sampling
Theorem and Aliasing Errors</span></big></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">
<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It
was mentioned above that computers
are very fast and A/D converters can
sample signals at very high rates to closely approximate the original
continuous analog signal</font>.
&nbsp;However, since there signal has
discrete data points at certain points in time, all information between
those discrete samples is lost. &nbsp;The sampling theorem states
that
a signal must be sampled at a rate that is more than twice the highest
frequency component in the signal.</span></big></p>
<p><img src="SignalConditioningLab4.jpg" align="right" height="690"
 width="457"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The top figure
on the right
shows a 1 Hz sine wave sampled at 2Hz. &nbsp;We can see that the
peaks
have been captured but even if the samples were not exactly at the
peaks, the best fitting sine wave would match the actual 1Hz sine
wave.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The middle graph
shows the same signal sampled at 3 Hz.
We can see that there are more than enough samples and that the best
fitting sine wave matches the true 1Hz sine wave signal.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">However,
if we only sampled the signal at 1.5 Hz we would get the results in the
bottom graph. &nbsp;The red line shows a perfect fit by a 0.5Hz
sine
wave. &nbsp;It turns out that signals above one half the sampling
rate are not lost but distorted to appear as a &nbsp;lower
frequency. &nbsp;This distortion is called an "aliasing" error and
frequency that is one half the sampling rate is called the "Nyquist"
frequency.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="SignalConditioningLab5.jpg" align="right" height="320"
 width="430"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Some call the
Nyquist frequency the "folding" frequency because the distortion folds
all frequencies above one half the sampling rate over to the lower
frequencies between 0 and the Nyquist frequency. &nbsp;The figure
to the right
shows how a signal sampled at 60 Hz can faithfully record signal
components up to 30Hz and all higher frequencies are distorted (folded
over) to look like lower frequencies. If we were to sample a 137 Hz
sine wave at 60 samples per second, the data would appear to be a 17Hz
sine wave.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another example
of aliasing is the appearance of wheels in movies rotating backward or
slowly forward even though we know the vehicle is traveling quickly.
&nbsp;The figure below shows a wagon wheel filmed as it rotates.
&nbsp;The spokes actually rotate forward several degrees but our
eyes are deprived of information between the discrete film frames and
since the spokes are similar, our eyes interpret the motion of the
spoke as rotating slowly backward. </font>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Analog to digital
conversion is an important consideration of signal conditioning because
most subsequent processing of the signal is performed by the computer.
Now that we know the important considerations of resolution and
sampling rate, we can continue with other important aspects of
biomechanical signal processing. &nbsp;The next section covers
differentiation and integration and then filtering and noise removal. </font>
