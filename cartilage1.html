Cartilage</u></font></p>
<p><img src="cartilage1.jpg" align="right" height="375" width="300"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Articular
cartilage is the dense, white connective tissue that covers the ends of
each bone in an articulating joint. The purpose of articular cartilage
is to protect ends of bones by distributing the load over a greater
area and to reduce friction within the joint. The diagram at the right
shows an articulating joint that has a joint capsule filled with
synovial fluid.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Composition of
Articular Cartilage:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">- 60-85% water.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">- 10-39% collagen</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">-3-10%
proteoglycan
gel</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">- 1-2%
chondrocytes.</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Mechanical
Properties:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Collagen fibers
are arrnged in criss-crossed matrix. Proteoglycan gels create a
swelling pressure that puts the collagen fibers in tension.
&nbsp;As
the cartilage is loaded in compression, the collagen fibers
are&nbsp;still
in tension (much like the latex in a ballon). &nbsp;The membrane is
semi-permiable and allows water to move across the membrane but does
not allow the proteoglycan gels to leave the cartilage. &nbsp;As
water
is squeezed out of the cartilage, in concentration of proteoglycan gels
increases which increases the swelling pressure. &nbsp;This
mechanism
helps protect the cartilage from being compressed too much.</font></p>
<p><img src="cartilage2.jpg" align="right" height="322" width="522"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The diagram to
the
right shows the response of articular cartilage to a constant load.
&nbsp;At first, water leaves the cartilage rapidly which causes a rapid
deformation. &nbsp;As the concentration of the proteoglycan gels
increases, less water leaves. &nbsp;This gradual deformation is
called
"creep" and is not like a typical spring of constant stiffness which
deforms instantaneously.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Standing for
long
periods of time results in a large creep deformation of the cartilage
which reduces its ability to protect the bones and causes joint pain.
&nbsp;For this reason, we shift our weight from one foot to the
other
to allow the water to flow back into the cartilage.</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Lubrication:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">As the joint
rotates, the cartilage exudes water in front of and under the stress
area which improves lubrication and decreases wear
(see&nbsp;below).
After peak load, fluid is re-absorbed back into the articular cartilage.</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Wear:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Wear is defined
as
the removal of material via mechanical action. Wear results in reduced
collagen fibers which reduces the strength of the cartilage and the
stiffness of the matrix.</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Arthritis:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">
</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Arthritis
is a condition that makes the joints swell. This swelling is the result
of bones rubbing against each other without the protection of cartilage<font
