<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">During the
rowing
cycle, rowers sit on a sliding seat with their feet held stationary.
&nbsp;The Gastrocnemius muscle is generally considered to be a
two-joint muscle that tends to plantar flex the ankle and flex the knee
joint. In 1903, Lombard postulated that under certain conditions, a
two-joint muscle might have the opposite effect and he used the term
"pseudo antagonist". &nbsp;For a more complete discussion on this
topic
please feel free to read Art Kuo's paper on&nbsp;<a href="ArtKuoLombardParadox.pdf">Lombard's Paradox</a>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the diagram
below,
ignore the influence of gravity and of
the trunk and upper extremities and calculate the moment of force
produced at the knee joint by the Gastrocnemius muscle given the muscle
force of 500N and the given dimensions.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Consider the
frame consisting of the leg and thigh in static equilibrium and
calculate the joint reaction forces. &nbsp;To remain in static
equilibrium, we will first consider the seat to be fixed (unable to
slide). The first step is to
consider the rigid frame as a whole to find the vertical forces A<sub>y</sub>
and C<sub>y</sub>.
The figure below shows the free body diagram using
the dimensions given above.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to keep
the rower in static equilibrium, there must be a 24.7 N force
preventing the seat from sliding to the right. &nbsp;In reality,
the rollers on the seat would prevent static equilibrium, the leg and
thigh segments would accelerate and an exact calculation of the
vertical and horizontal reaction forces would need to include the
inertial component of force. &nbsp;However, the reaction forces
would only change in magnitude and the motion would be an extension of
the knee.&nbsp; Therefore,
since
the Gastrocnemius muscle is the only force acting (other than reaction
forces), the result is an extension moment about the knee joint and a
motion that slides the seat to the right. &nbsp;In this situation,
the Gastrocnemius muscle contributes to knee extension.
&nbsp;Furthermore, if we were to calculate the length change of the
Gastrocnemius, we would see that the muscle actually shortens from this
point to full knee extension which indicates positive power in a
concentric contraction. It also needs to be stated that when the knee
is flexed and the hips are quite close to the feet, the Gastrocnemius
would be a flexor of the knee - there is a critical angle for theta in
the above example when the muscle changes from a flexor moment to an
extensor moment.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">When we discussed joint power and muscle power in
the "Power Flow" lecture, we would calculate the knee moment to be an
extensor moment and assume that the knee extensors were the dominant
group. We would then multiply the net extensor moment by the angular
velocity of the thigh (which would be a positive power) and assume that
the knee extensor muscles were generating power and doing positive work
on the thigh segment. There would also be a generation of power by the
knee extensors to the leg segment. By integrating power to get the work
done, we would get the correct value of muscle work. However, we would
attribute all of the work to the knee extensor muscle group when in
reality, some of that work was done by Gastrocnemius.</font>
</p>

<p><img src="Flexornot5a.jpg" align="right" height="527" width="398"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Consider the two
joint, six muscle system pictured to the right. &nbsp;Four of the
muscles are simple&nbsp;one-joint muscles that flex or extend the
two
joints.
&nbsp;Muscles 5 and 6 are two-joint muscles.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Muscle 6 would
anatomically be defined as a flexor of joint 1 and as an extensor of
joint 2. &nbsp;However, we can see that due to the vertical sliding
constraint, if muscle 6 is active, it will cause segment 2 to slide
upward which will extend joint 2 and also joint 1 even though it is a
flexor of joint 1.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Much like our example of the rower's Gastrocnemius,
in a power analysis, we would calculate the correct amount of work done
but we would
attribute some of the work done by muscle 6 to the extensors of joint
1. Muscle 6 would still be considered to have contributed to the work
done in extending joint 2 but not it's contribution to the work at
joint 1.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If we consider muscle 6 to be contracting
isometrically (neither stretching or shortening), then we can see as
muscle 1 extends joint 1 muscle 6 will extend joint 2 by virtue of the
fact that it will not stretch or lengthen even though joint 1 is
extending. This isometric contraction is not doing any work but it is
transferring from the work done by muscle 1 to the top segment. Again,
in a power analysis, we would calculate an extensor moment about joint
2 and assume that work was done by the extensors of joint 2 when
really, all of the work was done by muscle 1 (an extensor of joint 2)
with some of that work passively transferred to the top segment by
muscle 6.</font></p>

<p><img src="Flexornot5b.jpg" align="left" height="527" width="398"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Suppose we were to
simplify the two segment system to have only muscle 1. We can see that
if muscle 1 contracts, it will cause the lower segment to extend but
joint 2 will also extend by sliding upward due to the constraint of the
sliding mechanism.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Does this mean that the one joint muscle crossing joint 1 can be considered an extensor of joint 2?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The answer is no.
If we did a linked segment analysis, we would find a net joint moment
at joint 1 that would indicate an extensor dominant group. The net
joint moment at joint 2 would be zero but there would be joint reaction
forces at joint 2. The power analysis would reveal the work done by
muscle 1 by the muscle power at joint 1 and there would be passive
joint power at joint 2 showing some of that work increasing the energy
of the top segment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The joint power at
the top would be zero because the velocity in the horizontal direction
is zero, and the reaction force in the vertical direction is zero.
Since power is force times velocity, the horizontal reaction force is
multiplied by a zero velocity and the vertical velocity is multiplied
by a zero force.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Summary:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It may be
convenient to classify muscle actions according to apparent moment
arms due to origin and insertion. &nbsp;However, the actual
consequences of activating muscles under various conditions can be
contrary to those classifications. A full biomechanical analysis that
includes estimations of individual muscle forces is required to
determine the exact role of a muscle in terms of actual consequences
and measures of actual work. &nbsp;In that sense, there really is
no paradox only an incomplete understanding of the potential roles that
a muscle can have.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Briefly, a
muscle can be considered to have an opposite action at a joint if each
of the following conditions applies</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">- the muscle
crosses more than a single joint;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">- the motion is
constrained to move to a certain direction;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">- the moment due
to the constraint reaction is greater and opposite to the direct moment
of the muscle about that joint.</font></p>
