Analysis of Human Movement</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to analyse
human movement quantitatively, we must measure human movement.
&nbsp;The most common method of measureing human movement is to use
film or video recordings with a method called "motion
capture".&nbsp;This lab presents the steps required to produce a video
tape or film that can be quantified and the typical method of making
the measurements.</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>The
Biomechanical Film or Video:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">There are only two
variables that can be measured by a video or film analysis. &nbsp;These
two variables are position and time. &nbsp;However, if we are careful
about how we produce the video, we can dervive many other variables
such as joint angles, velocities, accelerations, centers of mass, etc.
&nbsp;The following is a list of requirements:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Camera Placement:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A single camera
limits the biomechanist to a planar analysis. &nbsp;So the camera must
be placed perpendicular to the plane of motion.<br>
The camera should be stationary so that any motion from one frame to
the next would be due to the&nbsp;movement of the subject. &nbsp;Quite
often, the camera is placed on a tripod and levelled so that the
vertical axis will be in line with gravity and the height of the camera
is at the middle of the frame. &nbsp;Since tha camera cannot zoom in or
out, it must be paced far enough away so as to "see" the required frame.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Body segment
landmarks are normally placed on subject in a biomechanical analysis so
that joint centers can be digitized later.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">3) The image needs
to be scaled to life size using an object of known size in the plane of
motion. &nbsp;Often, a meter stick or calibrated object of known size
is placed in the field of view and in the plane of motion.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">4) Exact timing
information of frame rate is needed to establish velocity and
acceleration which not available. &nbsp;A falling object in the
background was used in the old days but this was replaced by light
emitting diodes within the cameras and quartz technology.</font></p>
