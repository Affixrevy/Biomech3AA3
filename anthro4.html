<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> In order to
maintain balance, the CofG must remain within the base of support. The
worker shown here has assumed a posture in which his CofG is within
the base of support. The box he is holding in his hands, however, is
outside the base of
support and as mass is added to the box, the CofG will move forward
until it reaches his toes. Find how much mass can he held in the hands
without losing balance.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Solution:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The easiest way
to solve this problem is to consider the toes to be the tipping point.
&nbsp;The whole body mass is 0.10m behind the tipping point and the
mass of the box is 0.18m in front of the tipping point. &nbsp;If
the sum of the moments about the tipping point is zero, we will have
the maximum mass that can be added to the box.</font></p>

Reaction
Change Method
</font></p>
<p><img src="anthro8.jpg" align="right" height="200" width="400"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> There is a
method
that allows the whole body center of gravity to be determined of a
living subject and even the segment masses. &nbsp;The method is
called
the "reaction change method" and requires a scale and a board upon
which
the subject can lie.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Knowing the
length of the board and the whole body mass of the individual, we can
calculate the location of the whole body CofG by using static
equilibrium. &nbsp;If the length of the board is 2.0m and the
subject weighs 75kg, we can use the scale reading and the sum of the
moments about the fulcrum to
determine the location of the CofG. &nbsp;Example: scale reading is
48.1 kg.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can also use
the reaction change method to determine the mass of a limb
segment.&nbsp;

<p><img src="anthro10.jpg" align="right" height="200" width="400"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Suppose the
subject
was to move his arm a known distance (d).</font><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> &nbsp;As
the arm is moved closer to the
scale, the scale reading will increase. &nbsp;Knowing the distance
that
the arm was moved, and the change in the scale reading, we can
calculate how much mass was moved. &nbsp;If the length of the board
is
2.0m and the
scale reading changes from 48.1kg to 48.4kg, we can sum the moments
about the fulcrum to
determine how much mass was moved that distance. &nbsp;Example: d =
0.21m.</font></p>
