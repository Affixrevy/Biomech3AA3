<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Objects are
considered to be geometrically similar if they have the same shape and
can be scaled by a single factor. &nbsp;The two triangles in the
figure below are geometrically similar if you can convert one into the
other by multiplying each side by the same value. &nbsp;Similarly,
the three dimensional cylinders are also geometrically similar if one
can
be converted into the other by multiplying all dimensions by the same
value.
&nbsp;It follows that the&nbsp;area of the two dimensional
objects will
scaled by the square of the multiplying factor and the volume of the
three dimensional object will scaled by the cube of the multiplying
factor In the case of the cylinders, the cross-sectional area would be
4
times greater and the volume would be 8 times greater.</font></p>

&nbsp; The tiny ant has a length of 2 cm and a mass of 0.004 grams.
The ant can lift over
five
times its mass and drag objects 25 times greater than its own mass.
&nbsp;A geometrically similar ant with a&nbsp;length of 0.5 m
(the size
of a small dog) would be 25 times longer, with a leg cross section of
625 times greater (25<sup>2</sup>)
and a mass 15625 times greater (25<sup>3</sup>).
&nbsp;Since the mass is 25 times greater than the cross-section of
its
legs, the stress on the legs would be 25 times greater.
&nbsp;Therefore, the ant would likely not be able to support it's
own
weight much less carry five times more.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The skeletons of
large
primates&nbsp;appear sturdier than their smaller counterparts.
&nbsp;In the diagram below, the siamang is about 1/2 the height of
the gorilla but we can see that when the skeletons are drawn with
the same height, the cross-sections of the long bones of the arms and
legs are scaled by a greater proportion than height. The gorilla has
about ten times the mass of the siamang (80 kg vs 8 kg).The term
"allometric scaling" was used to describe the
cross-section increasing by a greater amount than the longitudinal
scalar and keep the bone stress similar as body mass increases.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> &nbsp;
This is also seen in the branches of trees and other structures in
nature.&nbsp;</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This
does not apply to all animals. &nbsp;Fish quite often scale with
positive allometry in which the mass increase with length to the power
of 3.2. For instance, a 76cm muskie (muskellunge) has a mass 3.6 kg but
a 100 cm fish has a mass greater than 8.6 kg. This may be due to the
fact that the fish does not have to support its mass against gravity
and other inertial forces the way that terrestrial animals do.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If we compare the standard house cat with a tiger,
we can
see similarities in shape and may wonder if the tiger is simply a
larger scaled version of the house cat. The average domestic cat is
about 0.7m in length and about 5.0 kg in mass and the average tiger is
about five times longer than the cat. &nbsp;If the cat and the
tiger
are geometrically similar, we would expect the bones to be five times
longer, 25 times greater in cross-sectional area (5<sup>2</sup>),
and
125
times greater in mass (5<sup>3</sup>).
&nbsp;However, the average tiger
is not 125 times heavier, it is about 60 times greater (300
kg).&nbsp;</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The figure on the left shows a comparison of the
skeletons of a house cat and tiger scaled to have the same length from
shoulder to pelvis. If we look closely, we can see that the bones of
the legs of the tiger appear to have a greater cross-sectional area
than the legs of the house cat. Since the tiger's legs must support 60
times more mass it is good that they have more than just 25 times the
cross-sectional area.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Humans, as well as other animals do not increase in
size by
maintaining geometric similarity. &nbsp;A better approach is called
"allometric scaling" in which one dimension increases differently than
another. &nbsp;In the case of people (and many other animals),
their
transverse scalar does not increase as much as their longitudinal
scalar but is proportional by the power of about 0.75.
&nbsp;Therefore,
the tiger will have bones that are
5 times longer than the cat but the
cross-sectional area will be 17 times greater (5 x 5<sup>.75</sup>)
and
the mass will be 56 times greater (5 x 5<sup>.75</sup>
x 5<sup>.75</sup>).
&nbsp;This allometric scaling has structural implications because
the
stress that is placed on bones due to gravity is governed by the mass
and the cross-sectional area. &nbsp;If mass increases
proportionally
with the cube of length and cross-sectional area increases only with
the square of length, the tiger would have difficulty supporting 125
times more mass with bones that were only 25 times greater in
cross-sectional area. &nbsp;This is because the bone density of the
tiger is not different from the cat but the forces of motion are not
simply gravitational. &nbsp;Studies have shown that the effective
moment arms of muscles change with larger mammals such that the
required
muscle forces per muscle volume scale the same for mammals from mice to
horses. &nbsp;</font></p>

Considerations and Elastic Similarity:</big></font></big></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The Body Mass
Index
(BMI) is the most widely used index for ideal body weight for humans.
&nbsp;It
is
calculated by dividing body mass (kg) by the square of height (m).
&nbsp;If people were geometrically similar, mass should be divided
by
height cubed but, as noted above, this is not the case. &nbsp;A
better
exponent for bone mass (Mo) would be about 2.5 but fat free mass
(FFM)is roughly
proportional to the square of height for women and the power of 2.3 for
men (see the graphs below).
</font></p>


<p><img src="Scale5.jpg" align="middle" height="567" width="900"></p>


<p><img src="Scale3.jpg" align="right" height="378" width="500"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
greatest criticism of BMI as a measure of body composition is that the
mass could be fat or lean tissue and assuming a person has a large
amount of fat based on a high BMI is not necessarily a valid
assumption. &nbsp;Body builders with large amounts of muscle and
very
little fat have the same BMI as sedentary individuals with higher
percentages of body fat. &nbsp;BMI has been used by the French
fashion
industry to ban the hiring of models with a BMI less than 18 in an
attempt to reduce eating disorders in the industry. &nbsp;The
fashion
industry has a policy of hiring tall models because they appear thinner
than shorter models and this is supported by elastic scaling and is
further strengthened by the BMI rule.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the example to the right,
we
compare a 5'10" (1.78m) fashion model who weighs 130 lbs (59 kg) with a
geometrically similar 5'0" model. &nbsp;In order to appear as thin
or
equally proportioned, the shorter model who has 0.857 the height
(60/70=0.857), must have 0.857<sup>3</sup>
= 0.63 times the volume or
mass. &nbsp;This means that the shorter model must weigh less than
82
lbs (130 x 0.63 = 81.9) which is unrealistic. The BMI of the taller
model (A) is 18.6 but the BMI for the geometrically similar model (B)
would only be 16.0. &nbsp;A healthy 5'0", 100 lbs model is also
shown
(C) and appears less thin than the taller model even though they both
have
a healthy 20% body fat. &nbsp;To be geometrically similar by
reducing
body fat and appearing the same as the taller model, the shorter model
would have to reduce her body fat to 5.3% which is too extreme to be
considered healthy.</font></p>

<p><img src="Scale10.jpg" align="right" height="550" width="357"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Humans are
elastically similar such that the transverse scalar does not increase
the same amount as the longitudinal scalar. In this regard, the
BMI&nbsp;which divides mass by height squared is a better match
than the
assumption of geometric similarity which would divide body mass by
height cubed. The figure to the right shows&nbsp;cylinder A of 50
kg mass, a density of 1.1 (fat free), a height of 160 cm and a diameter
of 18.9 cm. A 100 cm area has 10 kg of fat with a density of 0.9
wrapped around a 100 cm zone. Cylinder B is 10% taller (176cm), 21%
heavier (1.10<sup>2</sup>), 21% more fat (12.1 kg) and
appears thinner even though both objects have the same % body fat, BMI
and cylinder B has a greater diameter and the ridge of fat radius is
larger. Cylinder B also appears more frail and we know that with
geometric scaling, objects become more frail with increased size
because mass increases with L<sup>3</sup> and
cross-sectional area only increases with L<sup>2</sup>
which means stress (force/cross-sectional aarea) increases.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> Even though allometric scaling helps to reduce the
problem of increased stress on the bone than geometric scaling, will
taller individuals actually be more frail? The data of Haymsfield
(above) shows that bone mass scales with the power of 2.67 vs height
(1.97) in women which helps the bones maintain stress. In the example
to the right, the taller object has a diameter that is 5.6% greater
than A which would yield a cross-sectional area that is 11.4% greater
(1.056<sup>2</sup>) and must support 21% more mass. This
would indicate that the stress is greater on B but if the bone diameter
scaled more geometrically (2.67&nbsp;according to Haymsfield) this
would change the bone cross-sectional area to be L<sup>1.67</sup>
which would mean that the 10% longer bones would have a cross-sectional
area of 1.1<sup>1.67</sup> = 1.17 which is 17% greater
cross-sectional area to support the 21% greater mass.</font></p>


<p><img src="Scale12.jpg" align="left" height="425" width="320"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Due to allometric scaling, tall humans may appear
thinner and more frail than their shorter counterparts but the reality
is they likely have a greater percentage of body fat than they appear
and are less frail
than they appear.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">How is it
possible
for a woodpecker's head to withstand accelerations of 1500 g when
humans cannot tolerate accelerations greater than 400 g?</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The answer to
that
question can be found in scaling. &nbsp;If we assume that the brain
tissue of humans and woodpeckers can withstand the same stress and that
stress is equal to force per cross-sectional area, and force = mass x
acceleration, then we can scale the stress knowing the mass,
cross-sectional area, and acceleration.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Stress = force /
cross-sectional area = (mass x acceleration) / cross-sectional area<br>


Mass: Human =
1.4
kg, &nbsp;Woodpecker = 0.002 kg<br>


Cross-sectional
Area: Human = 113 cm<sup>2</sup>,
&nbsp;Woodpecker = 1.54 cm<sup>2</sup><br>


Assuming the
human
brain can tolerate 400g of acceleration, the stress would be 1.4(400 x
9.81)
/
113 = 48.6 N/cm<sup>2</sup><br>


For the same
stress, the woodpecker could withstand an acceleration of 48.6(1.54) /
(0.002
x 9.81) = 3814 g</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can see that
due
to the much smaller mass of the woodpecker's brain, it can withstand
accelerations almost ten times larger than the human brain.

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Performance
Considerations:</big></font></big></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Muscle force is
proportional to the cross-sectional area. &nbsp;Larger people are
stronger than small people because they have a greater cross-sectional
area of muscle. &nbsp;For this reason, weightlifting competitions
have
weight classes to make the competition fair. &nbsp;An examination
of
weightlifting records indeed shows that the heavier weight classes lift
greater weight but if we divide the weight lifted by the lifters body
mass, we see that the smaller lifters lift more weight per body mass
than the larger lifters. &nbsp;The reason for this is that
the&nbsp;lifters must raise their own mass in addition to the mass
of
the weight and since body mass increases to a greater extent than
muscle cross-sectional area (volume vs area), the larger lifters have a
disadvantage.</font></p>


<p><img src="scale4.jpg" align="right" height="500" width="381"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We know that
vertical jump
performance depends on the power to weight ratio (Dowling and Vamos, 1993). Now lets look at the
effects of scale with a comparison
of
the cat with the tiger. As mentioned above, a geometrically larger cat
with five times the leg length would have muscles that are 25 times
greater cross-sectional area and 25 times more force. &nbsp;The
mass of the large cat would be 125 times greater and so too would the
muscle power because the 25 times greater force would be multiplied by
a five times greater velocity (due to the muscles being five times
longer). Therefore, the power to weight ratio would be the same.
&nbsp;However, the tiger is elastically similar and has a force
increase of 17 and a mass that is 56 times greater. &nbsp;The power
would be 17 x 5 = 85 times greater which gives an increased power to
weight ratio for the tiger. The power to weight ratio is only modestly
greater than the house cat and each animal has a similar vertical jump
height - both animals can raise their CofG about 1.5 meters.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;An interesting discovery of human and animal
motion
is that
high degree of dynamic similarity exists. &nbsp;It has been shown
that
the speed at which quadrupedal animals switch from a walk to a trot, to
a gallop can be scaled to the length of their legs. &nbsp;For
example,
the horse has a much longer leg than a dog but the speed at which each
switches from a walk to a trot has the same "Froude Number".
&nbsp;This
also exists for humans (see below).

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Does a tall
pitcher with
long arms have an advantage for throwing a ball at high velocity? If we
take the example of two geometrically similar athletes with athlete A
20% taller than athlete B. Athlete A would have an arm that is 20%
longer than Athlete B, the muscle cross-sectional area (force) would
be 44% greater (1.2<sup>2</sup>
= 1.44), and the moment arm of the
muscle would be 20% greater. Therefore, the moment of force would be
73% greater (1.2<sup>3</sup>
= 1.73). However, the segment's moment of
inertia would&nbsp;be 149% greater which means that the limb of
Athlete
A would have 31% reduced angular acceleration as Athlete B which means
that Athlete A would attain an angular velocity that is 31 % lower than
Athlete B. &nbsp;With a limb that is 20% longer the tangential
velocity would still be 17% lower due to the lower angular velocity
(see the example below).</font></p>
