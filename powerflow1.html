<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In a previous
lecture, we saw how energy could be conserved by transfers within a
segment between potential and kinetic energy as well as transfers
between segments. &nbsp;We also saw how the power of a segment
could be calculated by using finite differences to yield the rate of
change of energy. &nbsp;In this lecture, we will look at a
different
way to calculate the instantaneous power of a segment. &nbsp;This
method calculates joint powers as the product of force and velocity as
well as muscle powers as the product of net joint moments and the
angular velocity of the segment. &nbsp;We start with the joint
reaction forces and net joint moments at the proximal and distal ends
of the segment that were obtained from a <a href="linked1.htm">linked
segment analysis</a>.</font></p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">There
are four pathways for power to flow into or out of the segment.
&nbsp;The muscle powers are actively generated or absorbed by the
muscles crossing the proximal and distal joints. &nbsp; A positive
muscle power indicates a concentric contraction in which the muscle is
generating power to the segment. &nbsp;A negative muscle power
indicates an eccentric contraction in which the muscle is absorbing
power from the segment. &nbsp;These powers will be further
interpreted later.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The joint powers
are passive transfers between the segment and an adjacent segment.
&nbsp;A positive joint power indicates a passive flow of power into
the segment from the adjacent segment. &nbsp;A negative power
indicates a passive flow of power out off the segment to the adjacent
segment.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example:
Calculate the thigh segment power for frame 60 using the following data.</font></p>

<p><img src="powerflow2.jpg" align="middle" height="600" width="900"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In a previous
<a href="power1.html">lecture</a>, we calculated the
power of the thigh
segment for frame 60 by
calculating the rate of change of energy between frames 59 and 61.
&nbsp;With that method we obtained a value of 48 W.
&nbsp;Theoretically, both methods should yield the same value but
they often differ due to small measurement errors that accumulate.
&nbsp;The instantaneous power generally has more error because it
uses joint reaction forces and net joint moments which require
accelerations. &nbsp;Recall from the lab portion that accelerations
are obtained by twice differentiating the displacement data from video
and that each differentiation suffers from high frequency noise
amplification. &nbsp;The rate of change of energy method only uses
velocity estimates.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In spite of its
accuracy disadvantage, the instantaneous power method is more valuable
because it contains diagnostic information regarding how the segment
receives
or loses energy. &nbsp;The next page examines this diagnostic
information further.</font></p>
