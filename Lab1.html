1: The
Scientific Method</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The goal of
science
is to explain. &nbsp;Before you can explain, you must be able to
describe. &nbsp;Before you can describe, you must be able to
measure.
&nbsp;This lab leads into issues concerning biomechanical
measurements
but first, we will look at the scientific method and understand how
scientists think, discover, prove and explain.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Ways of
Knowing: </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1) method of authority - an expert told me it is true so it must be
true.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2) method of tenacity - I have always known it to be true and I'm not
changing.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3) a priori method - it seems self evident, agrees with reason or my
intuition tells me it is true.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4) method of science - Unlike the methods above, this method has the
ability of self correction. &nbsp;This method systematically builds
theories, subjects them to rigorous testing, realizes that they may not
reflect reality even if they fit all present observations and never
accepts the metaphysical as an explanation. &nbsp;A more complete
description is given below.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Method of
Science:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">It is that
method
for describing and explaining phenomena which incorporates the
principles of empirical verification, operational definition,
controlled
observation, statistical generalization, and empirical confirmation.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1) Empirical Verification - A descriptive statement is regarded as true
if and only if it is found to correspond with observed reality.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- empirical
means
based on experiment</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- observations
by
others can be accepted if reported properly (I can replicate their
experiment)</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2) Operational Definition - All terms in a descriptive statement must
be carefully defined in terms of operations involved in manipulating or
observing their referents.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- confines our
statements to things we can define</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- forces us to
talk in a way that communicates our exact meaning to others (no jargon,
slang or ambiguity)</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3) Controlled Observation - For an observation to provide an adequate
test of the statement that a change on A causes a change on B, variable
B must be observed when different values on variable A occur and,
moreover, when all other variables can be discounted as possible causes
of any change observed on B.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- experimental
control (only variable A changes)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- statistical
control (other variables change but their effect can be calculated and
subtracted)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- assumed
invariance (other variables are assumed to not change)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- assumed
irrelevance (effects of other variables are assumed to not have any
effect on A)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- randomization
(control by chance)</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4) Statistical Generalization - observations can be generalized to
conditions other than those under which it was made if the conditions
constitute an adequate random sample of the set of conditions to which
you want to generalize.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- statistical
power</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5) Empirical confirmation - An explanatory statement is regarded as
being more probably true as the number of verified descriptive
statements increases.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- hypothesis is
an
untested descriptive statement</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">-experiment
attempts to reject the null hypothesis (no effect)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">-&nbsp;rejection
of the null hypothesis does not mean an acceptance of the hypothesis
(significance levels)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- many
alternative
hypotheses need to be tested</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">- a theory
needs
to explain all observable phenomena to be considered a law.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Concluding
Remarks:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Not all
experiments are equally valid. &nbsp;Our ability to explain is
based on the strength of our arguments and our rigor in applying the
scientific method. &nbsp;Some questions lend themselves better to
this method than others but it is important to look critically at how
well we are applying the scientific method and how wrong our
conclusions might be. &nbsp;Instead of looking for evidence that
supports our beliefs, it is more important to search for evidence that
contradicts our present understanding. &nbsp;It is through the
systematic elimination of null hypotheses that allows us to progress
toward an explained universe.</font></p>
