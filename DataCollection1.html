Data Collection of Human Movement</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to
analyse
human movement quantitatively, we must measure human movement.
&nbsp;Kinematic variables are variables that describe human
movement. &nbsp;They include displacement, velocity, and
acceleration. The most common method of measuring human movement is
to use
film or video recordings with a method called "motion
capture" to collect displacement data. However, there are many ways of
performing motion capture and other methods to obtain kinematic
descriptors. This lecture presents several methods with the advantages
and disadvantages of each.</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Motion
Capture:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Cine
Filming:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Prior
to the 1980s, the most common method of motion capture used high
speed cinematic film cameras. &nbsp;The first use in quantifying
human motion was achieved by Eadweard Muybridge in the late 1800s.
Frame-by-frame analysis revealed aspects to motion that were previously
unknown. &nbsp;He is most famous for helping Stanford win a bet
that when a horse is trotting, all four hooves are off the ground while
the hooves are under the horse. &nbsp;Most artists painted horses
airborne with the limbs extended.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="DataCollection2.jpg" align="right" height="192" width="300">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the mid
1900s, pin registered cameras with perforated film allowed high speed
exposure of frames that made motion analysis
available to biomechanists. Typical movie cameras had a frame rate of
24 or 48 frames per second but the Locam camera pictured to the right
allowed rates of up to 500 frames per second. The cameras were
expensive and researchers
still had to project the frames for digitization. The process of
digitization was extremely tedious but electronic digitizers connected
to computers expedited the process considerably by the 1980's.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another factor
which must be considered is the shutter speed. &nbsp;In order to
properly expose the film, enough light must be allowed to reach the
film. &nbsp;A camera set at 50 frames per second does not expose
the film for 1/50 of a second. &nbsp;The exposure is usually much
shorter so that the image is captured almost instantly which prevents
motion blur. &nbsp;The images below show the results of three
shutter speeds. &nbsp;As the shutter speed increases, so too does
the sharpness of the image but high shutter speeds require more light
so quite often extra lights are used in biomechanical filming.</font></p>

<img src="DataCollection3.jpg" align="right" height="259" width="300">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2)
Video:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since
1980, video became
increasingly more popular than cine film due to the
lower cost of the cameras and improvements to computer software and
video interfacing that allowed automatic digitizing. Most video cameras
have a fixed frame rate of 30 frames per second which is not fast
enough to quantify many sport movements or impacts. &nbsp;High
speed
video cameras are available but the cost is higher. &nbsp;Video cameras
use a CCD that increases the electrical&nbsp;charge as light hits it
and records the image digitally rather than using film but the
biomechanist also
needs to be aware of the shutter speeds mentioned above for film.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another
consideration when using video to quantify human movement is the
necessity for
three dimensional coordinates. &nbsp;3-D video is
available, but at least two cameras are required and they must be
synchronized. &nbsp;Commercial system are available to do this but
many
who require 3-D data use the two systems below.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">3)
Optoelectronics:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">These systems
use infra-red light emitting diodes
(IREDs)
as markers on the subject. The subject wears a strobe control unit that
sequences the flashing of each marker. &nbsp;</font></p>
<img src="DataCollection8.gif" align="left" height="250" width="209">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
cameras are actually
sensors for the IREDs and they can detect the 3-D locations at very
high frame rates and with much better accuracy than video and they
require no digitization. &nbsp;At least two of the sensors must
"see" a marker in order to calculate it's three dimensional
coordinates. &nbsp;If less than two cameras see a marker, it is
listed as not found. &nbsp;With manual digitizing of film or video,
the researcher can estimate the location of a hidden marker but
optoelectronics requires interpolation of the data. &nbsp;Depending
the movement of the subject, the researcher may require several camera
units to ensure that a each marker is seen
by at least two sensors at
all times.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
disadvantage of these systems is that the markers require activation
with wires running from the subject to the strobe controller.
&nbsp;There are wireless transmitters today but they require a
battery
and generally encumber the subject more than the passive markers used
in video. &nbsp;Emerging lithium ion battery technology allows the
weight to be reduced and other wireless technologies will make subject
encumberment less of an issue in the future.</font></font></p>

Electro-magnetic:&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Magnetic systems
calculate position and orientation by the relative magnetic flux of
three orthogonal coils on both the transmitter and each receiver. The
relative intensity of the voltage or current of the three coils allows
these systems to calculate both range and orientation by meticulously
mapping the tracking volume. The sensor output is 6DOF, which provides
useful results obtained with two-thirds the number of markers required
in optical systems; one on upper arm and one on lower arm for elbow
position and angle. The markers are not occluded by nonmetallic objects
but are susceptible to magnetic and electrical interference from metal
objects in the environment, like rebar (steel reinforcing bars in
concrete) or wiring, which affect the magnetic field, and electrical
sources such as monitors, lights, cables and computers. The sensor
response is nonlinear, especially toward edges of the capture area. The
wiring from the sensors tends to preclude extreme performance
movements. The capture volumes for magnetic systems are dramatically
smaller than they are for optical systems.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Cine film and
video were originally used for two dimensional (planar) analyses.
&nbsp;The biomechanist would choose the plane of motion and
position the camera perpendicular to that plane. &nbsp;However,
many human movements have important components in more than a single
plane. &nbsp;The analysis can be extended
to three dimensions by using a second camera. &nbsp;Originally, the
two cameras needed to be situated perpendicular to each other but a
mathematical transformation called the "direct linear transform" (DLT)
allowed three dimensional coordinates to be calculated from any two
independent views of a marker. &nbsp;Even with the DLT, the cameras
need to be synchronized and there is added digitization and added cost
of multiple cameras.</font></font></p>

Single Camera:</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Recent
technology
has combined a traditional digital camera with a laser beam to create a
point cloud that measures the distance from the camera to an object.
&nbsp;At present, the technology is used in the popular video game
"Xbox Kinect" to sense the three dimensional movements of people who
are attempting to control the computer game. &nbsp;The accuracy is
not
as good as the 3-D methods above and considerable software must be
developed to convert the image and laser data into a 3-D model of the
human subject
but future developments may lead to a
very low cost 3-D method.</font></font></p>

the measurement of joint angles. &nbsp;Therapists often use a hand
goniometer to measure the range of motion. The device is a simple
protractor with two blades that can be rotated. &nbsp;The device is
positioned with the center over the joint and the two blades are
aligned with the two segments.</font></big></font></big></p>

Electrogoniometry
(ELGON):</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to
measure joint angles dynamically, biomechanists use a device in which
the protractor is replaced by an electrical component called a
potentiometer. &nbsp;The potentiometer is a variable resister just
like
the volume knob on a radio in which the voltage (volume) increases and
decreases as the knob is rotated.</font></p>

the
right shows the ELGON placed with the blades on the forearm and upper
arm and the potentiometer over the elbow joint center. &nbsp;As the
subject flexes and extends her elbow, the voltage will change
proportionately with the change in joint angular displacement.</font></p>
