<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">On the previous
page, we calculated the power of the thigh segment for Frame 60 of a
walking stride by taking the sums of&nbsp;joint powers and muscle
powers at the proximal and distal ends. &nbsp;On this page we will
interpret the diagnostic information that the powers contain.</font></p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Joint
powers are quite easy to interpret. &nbsp;They are simply the rates
of energy being transfered to or from the adjacent segment.
&nbsp;Linked segment systems can do work on each other by virtue of
the connection between them and the joint power is simply the rate of
doing that work. &nbsp;In the example above, we calculated a
joint power at the hip (proximal end) of 48.16 W. &nbsp;This is a
positive value which means that energy is flowing from the pelvis into
the thigh at a rate of 48.16 Joules per second. &nbsp;It also means
that the pelvis is doing work passively on the thigh at a rate of 48.16
Joules per second. &nbsp;Similarly, we also calculated a joint
power at the knee (distal end) of 19.97 W which means that the leg was
passively transfering energy or doing work on the thigh segment.
&nbsp;In each case, the adjacent segments were transferring energy
into the segment, doing positive work and attempting to increase the
energy of the segment. &nbsp;A negative joint power would indicate
a passive transfer of energy out of the segment or an attempt by the
adjacent segment to decrease the energy of the thigh.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The joint powers
are passive transfers between the segment and an adjacent segment.
&nbsp;A positive joint power indicates a passive flow of power into
the segment from the adjacent segment. &nbsp;A negative power
indicates a passive flow of power out off the segment to the adjacent
segment.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+2">Interpretation
of Muscle Power</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><img src="powerflow4.jpg"

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Muscle powers
are
more difficult to interpret. &nbsp;At first glance, they are
similar to joint powers in which positive values mean that energy is
flowing into the segment and negative values mean that energy is
flowing out. &nbsp;In the example above, we calculated a muscle
power of -19.77 W at the hip (proximal end) which means that the
muscles crossing the hip joint were absorbing energy or doing negative
work on the thigh segment at a rate of 19.77 Joules per second.
&nbsp;We also calculated a muscle power of -4.28 W at the knee
(distal end), indicating that the muscles crossing the knee joint were
attempting to reduce the energy of the thigh segment by doing negative
work or absorbing energy at the rate of 4.28 Joules per second.
&nbsp;However, to fully understanding which muscles are active,
what their role is, and how much work they are doing, we need to also
consider the adjacent segments.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">When we look at
the leg segment for
frame 60, we see that its angular velocity is -2.55 rad/s which means
that the -6.4 N.m knee moment results in the muscle power of
(-2.55)(-6.4) = 16.32 W. &nbsp;The 6.4 N.m moment at the knee was
caused by the knee flexor group of muscles. In this case, the knee
flexors were contracting concentrically, transferring 4.28 W of power
from the thigh to the leg and doing an additional 12.04 W of power on
the leg (4.28 + 12.04 = 16.32).</font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The following
table lists all the possible scenarios of muscle power generation,
absorption and transfer.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+2">Muscle Work</font></p>
<p><img src="powerflow6.jpg" align="right" height="640" width="400"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The
graphs on
the right show the knee joint angle, the knee net joint moment and the
muscle power during a complete walking stride. &nbsp;From the top
graph we see that upon heel contact (HC), the knee flexes to about 55
degrees before extending just prior to toe off (TO). &nbsp;It then
flexes and extends during the swing phase before heel contact ends the
stride and another begins.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The middle
graph shows the net joint moments calculated using linked segment
analysis. &nbsp;It can be seen that the knee extensor muscle group
is dominant throughout the stance phase with the flexors only working
late in the swing phase.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The bottom
graph uses the method described in this lecture to calculate the muscle
power throughout the walking stride. &nbsp; After heel contact, we
can see that the knee extensors have a negative power which indicates
an
eccentric contraction absorbing energy. &nbsp;The area under the
power-time curve indicates the amount of work or change in energy.
&nbsp;In this case, the knee extensors perform 53J of negative
work. &nbsp;Later in the stance phase, they do 31J of positive work
with a small 11J of negative work during early swing. &nbsp;The
knee flexors then become dominant absorbing 24 J and then contributing
5J of positive work at the end of swing.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">By examining
every joint in the human body during this activity, we can get a total
amount of positive and negative muscle work performed. &nbsp;This
value is quite important when examining the efficiency of human
movement which is the topic of a future lecture.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Summary and
Limitations:</font></p>
<p><img src="work4.jpg" align="right" height="175" width="850"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The method of
calculating work by examining segmental changes in energy was presented
earlier. It was noted at that time that some illegal transfer of energy
between segments could distort the amount of work. Although this method
of calculating muscular work is better because the joint power would be
zero if no energy is passively transferred between segments.
&nbsp;It
is also superior from the aspect that the active work is assigned to a
muscle group and identified as either an eccentric or concentric
contraction.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The muscle
power
calculation is the product of the segment angular velocity and the net
joint moment. &nbsp;We know that the net joint moment is the sum of
all
tissues crossing the joint and may contain a contribution by ligaments
and may have a co-contraction of the antagonist muscles. It is possible
that negative work performed to slow a segment near the extended range
of motion is done by the passive constraints rather than active muscle
contraction. In the case of a co-contraction, the calculation of 31J of
positive work in K2 above might possibly be a greater amount of
positive work by the knee extensors if the knee flexors were
simultaneously performing some negative work.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><img src="PowerFlow7.jpg" align="right" height="429" width="433"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The
existance of
two-joint muscles also complicates the situation because a rectus
femoris could contract isometrically and transfer energy from the
pelvis to the leg (bypassing the thigh segment) and this method would
under-estimate the work done by the hip extensors and over-estinate the
work done by the knee extensors. For example, the squat exercise could
be performed by having the hip extensor perform positive work on the
thigh segment and the knee extensors perform positive work on the leg
segment. The figure to the right illustrates&nbsp;a squat exercise
in
which the hip extensor performs all of the work and the two-joint
rectus femoris contracts isometrically transferring some of the work
performed by the hip extensor to the leg segment. &nbsp;The
traditional
linked segment analysis would under-estimate the work done by the hip
extensor and over-estimate the work performed by the knee extensors.
&nbsp;The total work calculation would be correct but the muscles
responsible would not be.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&nbsp;An
EMG
driven model to
estimate
individual muscle force (see previous lecture) would allow an even
better estimate of total work and the roles played by muscles and
passive structures.</font></p>
