and
Strain of Bone</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The purpose of
the skeletal system is to protect internal organs, provide rigid links
(segments) and attachment sites for muscles in order to facilitate body
movement. Bone is self-repairing and can alter its properties and
configuration in response to changes in mechanical demand. Up until
now, we have considered human limb segments to be rigid links but in
reality, no object is absolutely rigid. When forces are applied to an
object, it deforms. Some objects deform a lot (i.e. a rubber band) and
some objects deform only slightly (i.e. a steel bar). Click <a href="introenergy3.html">here</a>
if you wish to go back to the lecture on strain energy.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Mechanical
Properties of Bone:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Stress - The
force or load applied to an object is more correctly called a stress.
Stress is the force normalized to the cross-sectional area of the
object. The larger the object, the greater the force required for a
given stress.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Strain - The
more stress applied to an object, the greater the object deforms.
Strain is the deformation expressed as a percentage of the object's
non-deformed size.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The graph above
shows the typical response of an object. As the stress increases, so
too does the strain. At moderate levels of stress, the relation is
linear but as the stress becomes extreme, there is yielding and
ultimately failure when the stress becomes large enough to break the
object.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">3) Strength -
The maximum amount of strain that the material can withstand without
failure is known as the strength of the material.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">4) Stiffness -
The slope of the stress/strain relation is called stiffness. Stiffness
is also the inverse of compliance.</font></p>

<p><img src="bone2.jpg" align="right" height="320" width="400"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">5) Strain
Energy - The area under the stress/strain relation.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">6) Elastic
Region - The range of strain that does not result in yielding</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">7) Yielding and
Permanent Deformation - If a load is applied that exceeds the elastic
region but does not reach failure (dashed line), some yielding occurs
and when the object is unloaded, there will be some permanent
deformation

<p><img src="bone12.jpg" align="right" height="218" width="295"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">There are two
main
types of bone (Cancellous and Cortical). Cancellous bone is made up of
individual trabeculae, each with
it's own stiffness, that form a structure that has it's own unique
stiffness. Therefore cancellous bone has a material stiffness, which is
the stiffness of each trabeculae, and a structural stiffness, which is
the stiffness of the trabecular structure. Most biomechanical studies
of cancellous bone concentrate on structural properties because
material properties of trabeculae are difficult to measure. These
structural properties vary for different anatomical regions depending
upon the cancellous bone density and trabelcular orientation (Turner
and Burr, 1993).&nbsp;
Cortical bone represents nearly 80% of the skeletal mass. It is also
called compact bone, because it forms a protective outer shell around
every bone in the body. Cortical bone has a slow turnover rate and a
high resistance to bending and torsion. It provides strength where
bending would be undesirable as in the middle of long bones.
&nbsp;Cancellous (sometimes called Trabecular or
Spongy
bone) which is predominately at the ends of long bones. &nbsp;It is
less dense, weaker and less stiff than Cortical bone which is located
more on the outer layer. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Age
Effect:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">With
aging, we lose trabeculae and bone
mineral content and our bones become more stiff and less able to
withstand stress. &nbsp;The diagram to the right shows how the
older
bone fails at a lower level of strain and stress. &nbsp;Since the
area
under the curve is energy, older bone cannot absorb as much energy as
younger bone which makes it much more likely to fracture in the case of
a fall.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Dual Xray Absorptiometry (DXA) that we looked at
in the anthropometry lectures is often used to assess the level of bone
mineral content and risk of osteoporosis. The figure on the left shows
the changes in bone mineral content over the life span for men and
women. If a 40 year old woman is more than two standard deviations
below the average, she is considered to either have osteoporsis or at a
high risk of getting osteoporosis. It is important to note that the
bone mineral content is not necessarily equal to bone quality or bone
strength. Computer tomography can be used to further examine the 3D
structural integrity of the trabecular network and in regions of high
risk.</font></p>

Loading:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">a) Tension -
forces at the ends pulling away from each other.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">b) Compression
-
forces at the end pushing toward each other.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">c) Shear -
transverse force across the long axis.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">d) Bending -
see
full discussion below.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">e) Torsion -
twist
about the long axis.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">f) Combined
loading - most bone loading results in a combination of loading types.
&nbsp;Bending is actually a combination of tension on one side and
compression on the opposite side. &nbsp;As a structure, bone is
different than artificial materials insomuch as it will fail first in
tension. &nbsp;Most materials can withstand considerable more
stress in
tension than in compression but bone is the opposite.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Rate of
loading:</big></font></big></p>

<p><img src="bone10.jpg" align="right" height="400" width="556"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Due to
visco-elastic properties of bone, the stiffness and ultimate strength
increase as the rate of loading increases.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Shear
and
Bending Moment of a Beam:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We will use the
situation of "three point bending" to illustrate the shear forces and
bending moment that act on a beam. In this case, the beam is supported
by two forces (S1 and S2) with a distance (L) between them and an
applied force (F)
in the middle.</font></p>

<p><img src="bone5.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="750"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Example: Find
the shear force and bending moment given: F = 100 N, L = 0.7 m, l = 0.4
m</font></p>

<p align="left"></p>

<p><img src="bone5a.jpg" align="middle" height="600" width="750"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The sheer force
is 57.1
N and the bending moment is 17.14 N.m. &nbsp;The beam will
fail
because of the bending moment, not the sheer force.
&nbsp;Therefore,
the strength of the beam depends on its ability to withstand bending
stress.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Bending Stress
and
the
Area Moment of Inertia:</font></p>

<p><img src="bone6.jpg" align="middle" height="580" width="940"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Bones are not
rectangular beams but their shape has an effect on the stress and the
loading direction. &nbsp;The shape of bones is governed by needed
attachment points for muscles and skeletal strength in the face of
typical loading activities. &nbsp;Bones also house the marrow
necessary for red blood cell production which requires them to be
hollowed. &nbsp;Does this loss of bone material inside cause a
decrease in bone strength?</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>How Much
Weaker
are Hollow Bones?</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">To examine this
issue, we will consider the bone to be a circular rod. &nbsp;In the
example below, Bone A is a solid rod with a diameter of 2.0 cm (radius
= 1.0 cm). &nbsp;Bone B also has a diameter of 2.0 cm but a 1.0 cm
diameter section has been removed from the center.</font></p>

<p><img src="bone7.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="750"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The hollow bone
has a lower area moment of inertia with the same value for C which
means that it will experience greater stress for the same bending
moment. &nbsp;However, it also has less mass since material was
removed from the center. &nbsp;If we were to add the mass removed
from the center to the outside so the two bones had the same mass, we
would increase the area moment of inertia and also increase C.
&nbsp;In this case, the mass from the center increases the radius
to 1.118 cm.
</font></p>

<p><img src="bone8.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="750"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Therefore,
hollow bones are actually stronger than solid bones of the same mass.
&nbsp;This is why bicycle frames are made of tubes rather than
solid rods. &nbsp;Ultimate bending stress of human cortical bone
has been found to be about 208 N/mm<sup>2</sup>.
If a bone had a
diaphysis (shaft) of 20 cm in length, an area moment of inertia of
1.178 cm<sup>4</sup>,
and a center distance of 1.118 cm, it could
withstand a bending moment of 20800(1.178)/1.118 = 21900 N.cm or 219
N.m. &nbsp;If a load was placed half way between two supports 20 cm
apart, the shear force would be 2190 N and the load would be 4380 N.
&nbsp;If the bone was solid, the bending moment would only be 163.3
N.m
and it could only withstand a load of 3266 N.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">As mentioned
earlier, bone loading is often a combination of loading types and
bending strength is not the only concern. &nbsp;If the hollow gets
too
large and the shell too thin, the bone strength is compromised for
impact or shear strength. &nbsp;Birds have bones that are more
hollow
because mass is a greater concern than strength for flight.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Fatigue
Fracture:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Repeated
loading at strains below the ultimate strength can still cause failure
in any material if the frequency and number of repetitions is high
enough. &nbsp;A common experience is to bend a coat hanger back and
forth until it breaks into two pieces. &nbsp;Fatigue microdamage is
responsible for this type of failure. &nbsp;Running and skiing
injuries
involving bone fracture often occur after a long session of activity
and the microdamage may be a contributing factor. &nbsp;However, it
may
also be due to muscular fatigue because the muscles play a role in
reducing bone stress. &nbsp;Muscles crossing human joints produce
moments of force but they also produce compressive forces. &nbsp;As
we
have seen, a bending moment places one side in tension and the other in
compression. &nbsp;Since bone fails first in tension, the
compressive
muscle forces reduce the tension caused by bending.
&nbsp;Therefore, it
could be the loss of muscle force due to fatigue that does not provide
sufficient protection to a bending moment that causes the fracture.
&nbsp;A skiing fall late in the day may result in more damage than
a
similar fall earlier in the day due more to muscular fatigue than to
microdamage in the bone itself.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Unlike
artificial
materials, bone is self repairing and the microdamage caused by
repetitive loading is of less concern because over time, the bone can
remodel and repair the microdamage. </font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Bone
Remodeling:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Bone can adapt
by
changing its size, shape, and composition (Wolff's Law).
&nbsp;Modeling
refers to
the
rapid changes in size and shape during development and is greatly
reduced in adult bone. However, exercise can achieve results post
adolescence.The remodeling of
bone in response to loading is achieved via mechanotransduction, a
process through which forces or other mechanical signals are converted
to biochemical signals in cellular signaling. Mechanotransduction
leading to bone remodeling involve the steps of mechanocoupling,
biochemical coupling, signal transmission, and cell response. The
specific effects on bone structure depends on the duration, magnitude
and rate of loading. When loaded, fluid flows away from areas of
high compressive loading in the bone matrix. Osteocytes are the most
abundant cells in bone and are also the most sensitive to such fluid
flow caused by mechanical loading. Upon sensing a load, osteocytes
regulate bone remodeling by signaling to other cells with signaling
molecules or direct contact. Additionally, osteoprogenitor cells,
which may differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts, are also
mechanosensors and may differentiate one way or another depending on
the loading condition. The mechanical
properties of the bone
material are matched to mechanical loads by remodeling. &nbsp;That
is,
the material properties are changed rather than the bone geometry.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Three
Rules for
Bone Adaptation to Mechanical Stimuli:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">1) Bone
adaptation
is driven by dynamic rather than static loading. &nbsp;Strain is
important and explains why gymnasts have greater bone density than
swimmers. &nbsp;Plyometric exercise may be particularly beneficial.</font></p>

<p><img src="bone14.jpg" align="right" height="226" width="329"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">2) Only a short
duration of mechanical loading is necessary to initiate an adaptive
response. &nbsp;Long periods have diminishing returns.
&nbsp;Bone mass
(as a percent of controls) = 100 + 11 log(1 + N) where N is the number
of cycles per day.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">3) Bone cells
accommodate to a customary mechanical loading environment.
&nbsp;They
are less responsive to routine loading signals.</font></p>
