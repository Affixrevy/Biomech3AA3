with Air Resistance</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In
the previous lecture ( <a href="drag1.html">drag
and cycling mechanics</a>
)
we saw that drag is the resistance to motion and is a function of the
square of velocity. &nbsp;In this lecture, we will combine the drag
coefficient, fluid density and projected area into a single constant
called "k". &nbsp;When an object falls, it has the force of gravity
acting downward and the drag force opposing that downward motion.
&nbsp; According to Newton's second law, the sum of these forces is
equal to the product of mass and acceleration. Re-balancing this
equation, we see that the&nbsp;acceleration of the object is a
function
of&nbsp;velocity which changes with time. &nbsp;If the object
is dropped with an initial velocity of zero, the acceleration is -g.
&nbsp;However, that acceleration causes an increase in the downward
velocity which in turn reduces the acceleration. &nbsp;When the
downward velocity reaches the point when k/m.V<sup>2</sup>
= g, acceleration will be zero and the velocity will remain
constant. This constant velocity is called "terminal velocity" and is
equal to the square root of m.g/k. &nbsp;The value for k is
proportional to the cross-sectional area so object with a very high
mass to cross-sectional area ratio will be little affected by air
resistance whereas objects with a low ratio will be greatly affected.
&nbsp;The famous experiment of Galileo dropping the cannon balls from
the leaning tower of Pisa would have turned out quite differently had
he used objects that were more influenced by air resistance.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><img src="air2.jpg" align="right" height="370" width="600"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Without
air
resistance, the acceleration was a constant -9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>
that
was easily integrated to yield equations for velocity and displacement.
&nbsp;With air resistance, however, the acceleration function is
more
difficult to integrate and requires the ability to solve first order
differential equations. &nbsp;In this case, we get a hyperbolic tan
function for velocity that reaches a maximum downward value (v<sub>t</sub>)
shown in the lower right graph. &nbsp;This value is commonly called
the terminal velocity and is dependent on mass, k and g as explained in
the paragraph above.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another method
to integrate complicated functions is to use the
numerical
method that we learned in the laboratory portion. &nbsp;A simple
computer algorithm is given below in which the acceleration is assumed
to be constant for a very short period of time to allow an area
calculation to be made. &nbsp;That area is equal to the change in
velocity and with this new velocity, subsequent accelerations can be
calculated. &nbsp;The same method can be used to integrate the
velocities and yield displacements. &nbsp;The figure below shows
the algorithm and results of a 70kg object dropped from a height of
300m with k=0.3. &nbsp;The time period was chosen to be 0.25s (delta
t)
but this value can be made smaller for greater accuracy. The last two
columns in the output show the actual velocity and acceleration using
the equations above for an object falling with air resistance.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The output for
the
acceleration is shown graphically below with the actual acceleration.
&nbsp;It can be seen that the area of the rectangles is easily
calculated and follows the actual accelerations fairly closely.
&nbsp;If the width of the rectangles was reduced by choosing a
smaller
delta t, the area would be closer to the actual velocity.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><img src="air4.jpg" align="middle" height="400" width="580"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If the object
starts with a positive or upward velocity, the air resistance will be a
downward or negative force since drag always opposes motion.</font></p>
<p><img src="air5.jpg" align="right" height="220" width="490"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The velocities
and displacements can be calculated with an algorithm similar to the
one above by changing the acceleration &nbsp;formula to have a
negative drag term instead of positive. &nbsp;This new algorithm
would apply until the velocity reaches zero at which time the object
will be at maximum height and then the original algorithm would apply
as the object falls.
