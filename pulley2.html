<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Gears are
similar to pulleys when a chain is passed over them (i.e. bicycle) but
they can also be connected directly. Since the teeth or cogs of the
gears must mesh with the same chain or with each other, the teeth must
be the same size which means that the number of teeth in the gear is
directly related to the radius of the circle and to the moment arm
through which the force acts.</font></p>

<p><img src="pulley11.jpg" align="middle" height="360" width="530"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since the
diameter of the gear is directly proportional to the number of teeth,
the ratio of the teeth is directly proportional to the force advantage
and speed disadvantage. Speed and force advantages are inversely
related just like levers and pulleys. It is easier to rotate gear "A"
because the resistance has a small moment arm. However, gear "B" will
rotate more slowly. Multi-gear bicycles are excellent examples of this.</font></p>

<img src="pulley8.jpg" align="right" height="500" width="400">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the diagram
to the right, the gear attached to the pedals has 42 teeth and the
smallest gear attached to the wheel has 14 teeth. For every rotation of
the pedals, there are three rotations of the wheel (42/14 = 3) which is
a speed
advantage but a force disadvantage. We can see the force disadvantage
because the moment arm of the small gear at the wheel is 1/3 the moment
arm of the large gear at the pedals. The circumference of the gear is
proportional to the radius (2 x &pi; x radius) so the number of
teeth is
proportional to the moment arm (radius of the gear). As we pedal, our
effort produces a moment of force on the pedals which puts tension in
the chain. The tension is the same force on the small gear at the wheel
but the moment is three times smaller because the moment arm is three
times smaller.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If we were to change the gear at the wheel to be
the larger gear with 21 teeth, the tension in the chain would remain
the same but the moment arm would increase which would allow a greater
moment of force to be applied to the wheel. The speed advantage would
be reduced to 2 (42/21 = 2) but the force disadvantage would also be
reduced. This would allow the cyclist to ride up a steep hill but at a
lower velocity.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another strategy to help climb a hill would be to
reduce the size of the gear at the pedals. If we were to change from a
42 tooth gear at the pedals to a 28 tooth gear, we would increase the
tension in the chain because the moment of force we apply to the pedals
stays the same but the moment arm of the gear is half which means the
force must double. For each revolution of the 28 tooth gear at the
pedals, the 14 tooth gear at the wheel will rotate twice so the speed
advantage would be reduced to 2 from 3.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A very large
force advantage is gained by using a worm gear. In the example below,
turning the handle through one revolution causes the worm gear to
rotate the lower gear by only a single cog. Since the lower gear has 42
teeth, you must rotate the handle 42 times to complete a single
revolution of the lower gear. This is often used to slowly lift heavy
objects such as the lifting of a car with a jack. </font></p>
