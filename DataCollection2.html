Data Collection of Human Movement</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to
analyze
human movement quantitatively, we must measure human movement.
&nbsp;Kinematic variables are variables that describe human
movement. &nbsp;They include displacement, velocity, and
acceleration. The most common method of measuring human movement is
to use
film or video recordings with a method called "motion
capture" to collect displacement data. &nbsp;We can differentiate
the
displacement data to get velocity and again to get acceleration.
&nbsp;Kinetic variables like force can be obtained by combining
kinematic variables and anthropometry. For example, multiplying
acceleration by mass yields force. However, in many situations we can
only calculate internal joint reaction forces and net joint moments
with the help of external force measurements that cannot be obtained
from motion capture. &nbsp;This lecture looks at ways of
directly measuring kinetic variables such as force.</font></p>

Gauges:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">-small,
thin electrical circuit that detects strain in the direction parallel
to the wires (see circuit below)</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">- as the
wires get stretched, the resistance increases so voltage must increase
to maintain a constant current.</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">- uses a
Wheatstone bridge (null detector) for small changes in resistance due
to compression or tension</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">- very
sensitive to temperature so usually two gauges are combined on opposite
sides to cancel the temperature effect.</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">- very
useful for devices that are handled by humans and for ground reaction
forces.<img style="width: 1000px; height: 335px;" alt=""

<p><img src="ForcePlateLab1.jpg" align="right" height="312" width="400"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">A force plate
is a three dimensional device. &nbsp;Although there are different
types of force plates, the basic principle of each is that tranducers
are placed in the four corners that measure strain due loads placed on
the surface. The diagram to the right shows how the corner transducers
can detect the amount of force applied in three orthogonal directions.
&nbsp;Fz is the total vertical force and Fx and Fy are two
horizontal forces due to friction. &nbsp;A vertical force that is
applied to the center of the plate would produce an equal amount of
strain on each corner. &nbsp;If the force is applied at a point
other than the center, the corner transducers will register unequal
strains and the plate can measure the tendency to twist the plate about
the X and Y axes. The device therefore produces an output of the three
orthogonal forces (Fx, Fy, and Fz) as well as the three orthogonal
moments (Mx, My,
and Mz). &nbsp;For more on the three dimensional
forces and moments,&nbsp;see
the <a href="3Dforce1.html">"3-D
Lectures"</a>
.<br>
Whenever an object contacts the plate, the plate resolves that contact
into a single reaction force with a point of application. &nbsp;The
point of application is called the "center of pressure" (CP).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Center
of Pressure:</big>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In the diagram
above, the center of the force plate is indicated by the intersection
of the two red dotted lines. &nbsp;We can see that the force is
applied
at a location other than the center and if we look at the Fz component,
we can see that this off-center application tends to twist the plate
about the X and Y axes.</font></p>
<p><img src="ForcePlateLab3.jpg" align="right" height="350" width="540"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The force plate
does not measure the
center of pressure directly - it is calculated by dividing the moment
by the vertical force. The diagram to the right shows a two-dimensional
view of a force plate sunk into the floor. &nbsp;The resultant
ground reaction force (F) has a CP which is 10cm from the center of the
plate in the positive
Y direction. The force plate measures the vertical force (Fz) and the
moment of force about the X axis which is coming directly out of the
page. The horizontal component (Fy) does not contribute to Mx and Mx is
due to the vertical force times the perpedicular distance from the
center of the plate (CPy). &nbsp;For example, if Fz = 500 N and Mx
= 50 N.m, the formula on the left shows that CPy = 50/500 = 0.10m or 10
cm. Similarly, if the applied force is off center in the X direction,
the formula on the right shows how CPx is calculated from My and Fz.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In a static
position, the center of gravity of the body must be directly above the
CP. In a dynamic movement, the center of gravity is rarely directly
above the CP and the CP is continually moving.</font></p>

yields a single resultant force vector applied to the plate.
&nbsp;Sometimes the clinician would like to know how the forces are
distributed within the contact area. &nbsp;In such cases, a
pressure pad is used or pressure sensors in a shoe insert are used.
&nbsp;These presure sensors are similar to an array of tiny force
plates that measure vertical forces based on the pressure applied to a
very small area.</font></font></p>
