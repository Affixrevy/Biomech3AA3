Humans Voluntarily Elicit Maximum Muscle Force?</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> In a previous
lecture on exercise, we saw that strength gains are thought to be due
to physiological as well as neurological factors. &nbsp;The
assumption was that humans can learn to increase the force application
of muscle in addition to the known physiological response of muscle
hypertrophy. &nbsp;Some have claimed that most people can
voluntarily activate their muscles to a maximum level. &nbsp;Those
claiming that individuals can elicit maximum muscle force with a
voluntary effort have used electrical stimulation as a proof. The
technique is known as the interpolated twitch technique.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The graph above
shows the results of four maximum twitches from electrical
stimulation delivered to an isometrically contracting muscle.
The data is from Chapman, et al. (1984). It can be seen (A)
that the twitch evoked by the electrical stimulation is greatest when
the
muscle was relaxed. As the level of voluntary effort
increased, the amount of force evoked by the stimulus was reduced.
&nbsp;When the muscle was contracting at the maximum voluntary
level, there is no sign of extra force evoked by the stimulation. When
Chapman, et al. graphed these results (B), they found that the extra
force evoked by the interpolated twitch declined linearly with
increased voluntary effort. &nbsp;This graph led to the equation
that many have used to calculate the level of voluntary effort below.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Many
researchers to this day use the interpolated twitch and the above
formula to determine the level of maximum effort exerted by their
subjects. &nbsp;Indeed, many believe that this result proves that
even untrained individuals are able to achieve 100% activation or very
close to it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Dowling, et al.
re-examined the interpolated twitch technique and found it necessary to
make modifications to improve the signal to noise ratio. &nbsp;We
know that the extra force declines to low levels at maximum effort and
that tremor increases at maximum effort. &nbsp;These two phenomena
combine to reduce the signal (extra force) and increase the background
noise (tremor). &nbsp;The diagram below shows the new experimental
setup that improves the signal to noise ratio.

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Non-linear
decline
of extra force has been seen by others since this experiment (Behm et
al.) The most important finding is the leveling off at high levels that
makes extrapolation impossible. Maximum muscle force will be when extra
force
is zero.</font></p>
