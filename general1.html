  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> General motion is a combination 
    of linear and angular motion. This is often very important in human movement. 
    In the example of the baseball pitcher (shown below), his shoulder is translating 
    forward as his arm rotates about the shoulder. The objective of the motion 
    is to deliver the required velocity (magnitude and direction) to the ball 
    before it leaves the pitcher's hand. </font ></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This velocity is measured 
    relative to the ground and is the vector sum of the ball's velocity relative 
    to the shoulder and the velocity of the shoulder relative to the ground. The 
    resultant linear velocity is calculated as follows:</font > </p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Since the hand is rotating 
    about the shoulder, the velocity of the hand relative to the shoulder would 
    be the tangential velocity. Assume that the radial distance of the hand from 
    the shoulder (r) is 0.58m and &theta; is 50 degrees and &omega; is 4.2 radians 
    per second. Assume also, that the shoulder has a velocity (V) of 1.8 m/s acting 
    horizontally with respect to the ground. Find the velocity of the hand with 
    respect to the ground.</font></p>
