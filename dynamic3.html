<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can see that
this formula could be used to calculate the moment about the proximal
end rather than the CofG.
This would allow us to neglect the reaction forces at the proximal end
but would require us to use the acceleration
of the proximal end and to calculate the cross product of the radial
distance between the proximal end and the CofG (r) with that
acceleration.
In static equilibrium, the accelerations at the proximal end (and every
point) are zero which is why we used the proximal end but in dynamic
equilibrium, it is easier to calculate the sum of moments about CofG.
When point P is the CofG, r is zero.

Linked
segments:</big>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since the human
body is considered to be a series of linked rigid
segments, it is useful to be able to determine the forces that join
the links because these are the joint forces. To do this, we use
Newton's third law that states that each force has an equal and
opposite reaction. &nbsp;The easiest way to demonstrate this law is
to
consider a train that consists of cars that are rigidly connected.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example:
Consider
the train engine has a pulling force of that accelerates itself
and
each railcar at 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>
and we wish to know the force in each couple as well as the force of
the engine. Assume that the mass of the engine is 50,000 kg, the mass
of
the first car is 20,000 kg and the last car is 15,000 kg.
Since the cars are
rigidly coupled to the engine and each
other, they all have the same acceleration.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can use free
body
diagrams to determine the forces in each coupling starting with the
last car and ending with the engine.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another way to
solve the problem is to total the mass and multiply by the acceleration
to get the force of the engine and then use the free body diagrams to
calculate the coupling forces. &nbsp;In biomechanics, we don't use
that method because the whole body center of gravity accelerations have
errors that propagate through the segment free body diagrams and the
trunk is not a very rigid segment which also
introduces&nbsp;errors. &nbsp;This topic is covered in more
detail in the "linked segment kinetics" lecture.</font>
