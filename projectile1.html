  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> A projectile is any object 
    that is given an initial velocity and then allowed to move under the influence 
    of gravity. Projectile motion is an important part of sport biomechanics because 
    of the use of balls, javelins, pucks, arrows, etc. The human body itself can 
    be considered a projectile whenever it is airborne (i.e. running, jumping, 
    falling, etc.). The path followed by the center of gravity of the object is 
    always parabolic. We will use the methods taught in the calculus lecture to 
    dervive the equations of projectile motion.</font ></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example: Find the time in 
    the air for a man jumping up on the platform and how far he will travel horizontally.</font >

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Step 1: The first step in 
    every projectile problem is to write the equations of motion.</font >
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Since gravity is the only 
    force acting on the subject, the acceleration in the y direction is -9.81 
    m/s/s and the acceleration in the x direction is 0 m/s/s. We use integral 
    calculus to yield the velocity and displacement equations.</font>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Step 2: Now we substitute 
    the given information of this particular problem.</font>
  <p align="left"> <img src="projectile3.jpg" width="585" height="120" align="center"> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Step 3: This is the most 
    difficult step because we must look at our six equations of motion and decide 
    which one or ones will help us find the answer to the question that we have 
    been asked. In this case we have been asked to find the time in the air. Although 
    time is part of all of the equations, we know that at the instant of landing, 
    the vertical displacement is 1.8 meters. Equation [3] is the vertical displacement 
    equation is we must solve for t when y(t) = 1.8.</font> 
  <p align="left"><img src="projectile4.jpg" width="400" height="200" align="center"> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In order to solve for t 
    in the above quadratic equation, we must use the determinate formula below.</font>
  <p align="left">&nbsp; <img src="projectile5.jpg" width="550" height="250" align="center"> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Solving the equation above 
    leaves two possible answers for t (using the positive and negative roots).</font>
  <p align="left">&nbsp; <img src="projectile6.jpg" width="400" height="140" align="center"> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The jumper's height was 
    1.8 meters high at two instants in time. We want the later time because that 
    is the time of landing. At the earlier time, the jumper was travelling upward. 
    If we are ever uncertain about the direction, we can substitute the time into 
    equation [2] and if velocity is positive, the motion is upward and if the 
    velocity is negative, the direction is downward. Therefore, the time in the 
    air is 0.687 seconds.</font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We were also asked to calculate 
    the horizontal displacement on landing. We can use equation [6] which is the 
    horizontal displacement function knowing the time of landing is 0.687 seconds.</font>
