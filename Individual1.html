Muscle Force Estimation</u></font></p>
<p><img src="Bone-on-Bone6.jpg" align="right" height="287" width="320"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the previous
lectures, we saw that joint reaction forces were not the same as actual
bone-on-bone forces.
Click <a href="Bone-on-Bone1.html">here</a>
if you wish to review that lecture. &nbsp;We also saw that direct
measurement of individual muscles in living human subjects was
unacceptably invasive and optimization lacked validity (Click <a
 href="Indeterminacy1.html">here</a>
for that lecture).
In this
lecture, we will look at a method of using electromyography to estimate
individual muscle forces and solve the indeterminacy problem. The
reader should already be familiar with the <a href="EMG1.html">EMG
lectures</a>.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Muscle
Model</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The EMG lectures
showed that electromyographic electrodes placed on the skin over a
target muscle or in the target muscle via fine wire, could measure a
signal that could be processed to reflect the amount of activity in the
target muscle.</font></p>
<p><img src="Individual1a.jpg" align="right" height="248" width="700"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This method is
shown in the diagram to the right.
Briefly, the raw EMG signal is full wave rectified and smoothed with a
lowpass filter. &nbsp;The signal is then converted to a percent of
activation by have the subject exert various levels of effort from
relaxed to maximum effort and fitting a linear or slightly nonlinear
line of best fit through the data (see the EMG lectures for details).
&nbsp;It was stated that this process could represent the force of
the individual muscles under isometric non-fatigued contractions.
&nbsp;We will first calibrate the percent activation to muscle
force and then developed the model to accommodate dynamic contractions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Calibration:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Calibrating the
amount of muscle force from&nbsp;% activation is not straight
forward
because many muscles cross the joint and produce the net joint moment
that we can measure. However, we know that muscle force is proportional
to cross-sectional area and the moment is achieved via the moment arm
of the muscle. Therefore, it is possible to partition the measured
isometric net joint moment into individual muscle forces based on the
moment arms and sizes of each muscle crossing the joint. The formula is
given below, along with an example of three elbow flexor muscles. The
subject performed a submaximal isometric elbow flexion of 44 N.m (M) of
which 2 N.m was due to passive stretch (P). The relative
cross-sectional
areas&nbsp;of the Biceps, Brachialis and Brachioradialis was 40%,
40%
and
20%, respectively (C) the activations were 37%, 46%, and 52%,
respectively (A) and the moment arms were 4 cm, 3 cm, and 5 cm,
respectively
(MA).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Individual1b.jpg" align="right" height="248" width="650"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
equation&nbsp;above allows the calculation of the kth muscle using
the size C, leverage (MA) and activation (A) of itself relative to the
total of all the muscles (m) in its group. By substituting the data in
the example, it was found that Biceps activation of 37% generated 374 N
of force (10.11 N per % activation). Similarly, when the same
calculation was made for Brachialis, its 46% activation was equal to
464 N (10.09 N per % activation) and 52% activation of Brachioradialis
produced 262 N (5.04 N per % activation). Adding this calibration
constant to the muscle model is shown in the figure to the right.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Force-length and
Force-velocity adjustments:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to
extend
the model to allow muscle force estimations in dynamic contractions,
we
must account for the fact that muscle generates different forces at
different lengths and velocities even if the activation is constant.</font></p>
<p><img src="Individual1e.jpg" align="right" height="413" width="650"></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
figure to the
right shows how the muscle model can be extended to include
force-length and force-velocity effects. The joint angle
kinematics must be measured and converted to the individual muscle
length. The force-length relation would have a value of 1.0 at the
optimum length and decline as the muscle shortens or lengthens from
that optimum. The force-velocity relation would have a value of 1.0 at
isometric or zero velocity and decline hyperbolically as shortening
velocity increases and increase with a lengthening (eccentric)
contraction. For more detail on these relations, click <a
 href="Muscle1.html">here</a>.</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">These
two
modifiers yield two unitless numbers that are multiplied by the
calibration constant to give an estimate of muscle force during dynamic
contractions.</span></big></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Other
considerations:</span></big></p>
<p><img src="Individual1.jpg" align="right" height="559" width="820"></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
muscle model could be even further extended to include fatigue effects
using the shift in median power frequency, stretch in the series
elastic element, recovery of stored elastic energy, potentiation
effects and even changes in electrode pickup as a function of joint
angle.</span></big></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Joint
Model</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since it is not
feasible to measure individual muscle forces in living human subjects
<a href="Inderterminacy1.html">(see the Indeterminacy lecture)</a>,
we must combine the muscle model with a joint model to estimate
the net joint moment which we can measure.</font></p>
<p><img src="Individual2.jpg" align="right" height="457" width="659"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The figure to
the right shows a method of multiplying each individual muscle force by
its respective moment arm and adding those to the passive joint
properties
(stiffness and viscosity) to produce an estimated joint moment that can
be compared to the
measured net joint moment. This is an indirect validation of the muscle
forces but if we test the estimations over a wide range of contraction
conditions, and the estimations are a good representation of the
measured moment, we can have confidence in the individual muscle force
estimations.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example:</font></p>
<p><img src="Individual3.jpg" align="right" height="596" width="450"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The figure to
the right shows the results of using surface electrodes over Biceps,
Triceps, and Brachioradialis as well as fine wire electrodes in
Brachialis. The EMG of each of the four muscles was processed to yield
forces that were multiplied by their respective moment arms which are
shown on the far right. The Triceps moment is considered to be negative
because it is opposite to the three flexor muscles. The bottom graph
shows the sum of the four muscle moments and passive moments to get the
estimated net joint moment which is plotted with the measured net
elbow joint moment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It can be seen
that
the estimated moment is quite close to the measured moment which gives
promise to the accuracy of the individual moments and muscle forces.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Problems with
Indirect Validation:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Even though
there
is a good agreement between the estimated and measured moments, there
is the possibility that the force in one muscle was over-estimated
while a synergist was under-estimated. &nbsp;If a poor agreement
results, it is difficult to determine which element in the model
requires improvement. &nbsp;Many of the elements in the model are
based
on literature values or animal research that cannot be directly
compared to an individual subject or patient. &nbsp;However, the
optimization method could only use phasic EMG patterns as validation
because the measured moment was already used in the partitioning.
&nbsp;Therefore, the EMG method of estimating individual muscle
forces
has stronger validation.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Direct
Validation with Animals:</font></p>
<p><img src="Individual4.jpg" align="right" height="591" width="432"></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
direct
measurement of individual muscle forces has been performed on animals
using tendon transducers. &nbsp;The figure on the right shows
measured tendon forces from a cat soleus muscle during walking (M).
&nbsp;EMG of the cat's soleus was also measured and applied to a
muscle model that yielded a predicted muscle force (P). The predicted
force is quite close to the measured force which indicates that dynamic
muscle forces can be predicted from EMG and directly validated.</span></big></p>
