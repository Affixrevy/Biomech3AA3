<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The angle of
attack (&theta;) affects the amount of lift and drag. As the angle
increases from zero to 90 degrees, drag increases from a minimum to a
maximum. Although lift and drag are orthogonal, lift is not a maximum
when drag is a minimum. In order to create lift, the angle of attack
must be greater than zero which means that there will also be some
drag. The lift force can be directed downward with a negative angle of
attack.</font></p>

Drag:&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Surface drag is
the resistance derived from friction between the surface of a body and
the
fluid
through which it is moving. The fluid particles adjacent to the body
slow down, causing turbulent flow. The magnitude of surface drag
depends on a number of factors; it increases with the relative velocity
of fluid flow, the surface area over which the flow occurs; the
roughness of the body surface; and the viscosity of the fluid.

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Form Drag:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Often called
"pressure drag" or "wake drag" it is&nbsp;more significant than
surface
drag for objects that do not have a streamlined shape. The streamlined
shape of a football has only two thirds the drag of a spherical ball of
the same cross-sectional area. As an object moves through the fluid or
air, the fluid separates and flows past the object. This is called
boundary layer flow and can be either laminar or turbulent. At low
velocity, the laminar flow creates a low pressure area behind the
object which tends to pull the object backward into the low pressure
area. &nbsp;This backward pull is the form or pressure drag. As the
velocity of the object increases, the boundary layer flow transitions
from laminar to turbulent. &nbsp;The velocity at which that
transition
occurs is called the critical Reynolds number. The Reynolds number is a
unit less number which is the product of the ball diameter and velocity
divided by the kinematic viscosity of the air. The Reynolds number of a
baseball traveling at 20 m/s is about 100,000 and the critical value
is about 150,000 which means as the velocity of the ball exceeds 30
m/s, the boundary flow transitions from laminar to turbulent and the
drag coefficient decreases. Due to its small diameter, the golf ball
has a smaller Reynolds number than the baseball and it reaches its
critical value of 40,000 at about 25 m</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">/s</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">. Notice that the
dimples keep the drag coefficient at about 0.25 for a range of Reynolds
numbers from 60,000 to over 200,000 which corresponds to a range of
velocities from 30 to over 100</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"> m</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">/s</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">.</font></p>

<p><img src="fluid9.jpg" align="middle" height="520" width="820"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">It is important to note that even though the
coefficient of drag C<sub>D</sub> decreases above the
critical Reynolds number, the drag force is a function of the velocity
squared</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">
(see the
<a href="Drag1.html"> "Drag and Cycling Mechanics"</a>
lecture) which means that if we plot the</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"> drag force over a
range of velocities that span the laminar and turbulent flow
conditions, the drag force still increases with velocity just a lower
rate than if the flow remained as laminar.</font></p>
