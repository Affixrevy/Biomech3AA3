</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The area under
a force-time trace is a measure of the impulse or change in momentum of
an object (see
the <a href="Impulse1.html">"Impuse-Momentum
Lectures"</a>
). &nbsp;The graph below is a trace of the vertical force applied
to the ground by a subject performing a vertical jump as measured by a
force platform. You can calculate the vertical impulse of the jump by
counting the squares as an estimate of the area. &nbsp;We know that
impulse is equal to the change in momentum which will allow you to
estimate the take-off velocity, height of the jump and the time in the
air. You can also validate your calculations of the time in the air by
using the
graph.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The
first step
is to idetify the body weight line. &nbsp;In this case, the subject
weighs 800 N. As the subject exerts a force against the ground that is
different from his body weight, his center of mass accelerates. If the
force is greater than his body weight, he has an upward acceleration
and creates positive impulse which in turn indicates a positive change
in momentum and a positive change in velocity. &nbsp;Conversely, if
the force is less
than his body weight, he has a downward acceleration, creates negative
impulse, has a negative change in momentum and a negative change in
velocity. &nbsp;The graph below indicates the positive area in blue
and the negative area in red. &nbsp;You can estimate the area by
counting the squares in each area and subtract the red squares from the
blue squares to obtain the net impulse of the jump.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Calculations:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">What is the net
number of squares (blues squares minus red squares)?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">How do you
convert the area from squares to Newton-seconds?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Multiply the
number of squares by the conversion factor to get the impulse of
the
jump.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Since impulse
is a change of mometum and the subject started from rest, the impulse
at take-off is equal to his mometum at take-off. &nbsp;Momentum is
the product of mass and velocity so if we divide the momentum by his
mass, we can estimate his take-off velocity.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">What is the
subject's mass?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">What is his
take-off velocity?</font></p>

</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Once in the
air, the subject is a projectile and you can calculate his
maximum height and time in the air<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">

projectile equations from the <a href="Projectile1.html">"Projectile
Lectures"</a>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">What

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">What

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">How
does your
calculation of the time in air compare to the measurement from the
graph?</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Which
estimate
is most likely correct?</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Even
if the
area calculation of the area and impulse was exactly correct, the
measured time in the air will be slightly greater than the calculation.
&nbsp;Why?</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Another
way to
look at the above calculations is to take the body weight line as zero
and divide all the force values by mass to get acceleration using
Newtons second law.&nbsp;The graph below is a trace of the vertical
acceleration. &nbsp;We can see that when the jumper is at rest, his
acceleration is zero. &nbsp;As he exerts forces against the ground
that are different from his body weight he has positive accelerations
when the force is greater than body weight and negative accelerations
when the force is less than body weight. &nbsp;At the instant of
take-off, the force drops to zero and his accelerations is -9.81 m/s/s.
&nbsp;During the flight phase, his acceleration is a constant -9.81
m/s/s which is consistent with projectile motion. &nbsp;If we were
to count squares and estimate the area under this acceleration-time
curve, we would be integrating aceleration to yield velocity </font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">(see
