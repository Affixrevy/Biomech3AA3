<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Examples of
changing moment arm lengths:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since the torque or
moment is determined by both the magnitude of the force and the length
of the moment arm, you can change the effectiveness of the force by
changing the moment arm length. This happens naturally within the human
body as shown in the figure below. As the elbow flexes from full
extension to about 90 degrees, the moment arm of the biceps muscle
increases which means that even if the biceps force does not change,
the amount of torque that it generates increases. As the elbow
continues to flex past 90 degrees, the moment arm decreases. This
changing moment arm is an example of gaining a mechanical advantage by
means of using leverage. Levers will be discussed in greater detail in
the next lecture.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Alternate Method of Calculating Moments
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Quite often, a second method of calculating moments
is preferred. If the location of the axis and the point of application
of the force is given in X and Y coordinates and/or there are more than
one force acting, this alternate method may be a better way to find the
moment of force.</font></p>

<img src="moment7.jpg" align="left" height="300" width="280">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the example to the left we are tasked with
finding the moment of force about the shoulder axis given the
coordinates of (0,0) for the point of application of Serratus Anterior,
coordinates of (0.05, 0.13) m for the axis of rotation and a muscle
force of 400 N. Our first method to find the
moment of force would be to find the moment arm, multiply by 400N and
then use the right hand rule to get the direction (positive or
negative).</font></p>

<img src="moment8.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="280">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This alternate approach resolves the force into two
rectangular components and uses the X and Y dimensions for moment arms
and then adds the two moments. The X component of force would be
400cos20<sup>o</sup> = 376 N and its moment would be
376(0.13) = 48.9 N.m. The Y component of force would be 400sin20<sup>o</sup>
= 136.8 N and its moment would be 136.8(0.05) = 6.84 N.m. The moment of
force would then be 48.9 + 6.84 = 55.7 N.m. We still must use the right
hand rule to see if either of the two components is a negative moment
before we calculate the sum.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">As stated above, this approach has some advantages
but I still believe that the ability to visualize&nbsp;moment arms
has tremendous value in biomechanics because it allows us to make
qualitative assessments of situations and how to improve them if we
wish to maximize torque for performance or minimize torque for injury
prevention.</font></p>
