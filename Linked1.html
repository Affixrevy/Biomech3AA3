Segment Analysis</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> This lecture is
an
extension of&nbsp;dynamic equilibrium to whole body human
biomechanical
analysis. &nbsp;We will combine the kinematics of motion capture,
the
kinetic data from external forces, and anthropometry of the human body
to calculate the internal joint reaction forces and net joint moments
during dynamic human movements. &nbsp;Recall, that a biomechanical
analysis requires the knowledge of the internal kinetics causing
movement for an understanding of why things are happening and for
better decisions to be made (Lab1). &nbsp;In order to get the most
from
this lecture, the reader should be familiar with static and dynamic
equilibrium, anthropometry and methods of kinematic and kinetic data
collections. We will begin with a typical example of calculating the
joint reaction forces and net joint moments of the lower extremity of a
subject during a normal walking stride. &nbsp;We will limit this
example for a single instant in time late in the push-off phase (i.e
frame 60 of a video taping).</font></p>

knee. &nbsp;If we examine the FBD of the foot, we see that a
negative
moment indicates the plantar flexors of the foot. &nbsp;Similarly,
the
FBD of the leg indicates that the knee flexors are producing the 6.64
N.m. &nbsp;If we had data on the thigh segment, we could continue
this
process to find the joint reaction forces and net joint moment at the
hip. We will interpret the net joint moments further in a future
lecture.</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>General
Approach to Linked Segment Analysis:</big></font></big></p>
<img src="Linked8.jpg" align="right" height="320" width="200">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In the example
above, we started with a FBD of the foot and worked our way proximally
to the ankle, knee and hip. &nbsp;In order to do so, we used the
data from a force platform to put ground reaction forces on our FBD of
the foot. &nbsp;If the foot was not touching the ground, we would
not need a force platform. &nbsp;It could be argued that ground
reaction forces could be determined by multiplying the body mass with
the accelerations of the whole body CofG.</font></p>
<img src="Linked8a.jpg" align="left" height="80" width="340">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">For example,
let us assume that we knew the mass
of the runner is 70 kg and accelerations of his center of mass was 0.8
m/s<sup>2</sup>
and 1.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>
in the x and y directions, respectively. &nbsp;The ground reaction
forces (GRF) in the x direction would be 70(0.8) = 56 N and in the y
direction would be 70(9.81) + 70(1.2) = 771 N.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">While this
method yields the magnitude of the ground reaction forces, it doesn't
yield the point of application on the foot.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Theoretically,
you could start at a free segment and work proximally toward the trunk
and then distally to the ground and determine both the ground reaction
forces and the point of application without a force platform.
&nbsp;However, in practice, this
results in rather large errors for two reasons. &nbsp;Any errors in
acceleration or anthropometry that cause errors in net joint moments
and joint reaction forces accumulate because those errors are carried
forward as we go from segment to segment. Secondly, the spine is
composed of multi-segmented vertebrae which can cause errors with the
rigid link assumption. Therefore, the general approach is to start with
the distal end of each segment using&nbsp;force platforms and
strain gauges to obtain the external force information and work
proximally to the trunk.&nbsp;
