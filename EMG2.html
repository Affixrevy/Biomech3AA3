<p><img src="EMG3.jpg" align="right" height="600" width="450"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The recorded EMG
from a whole muscle is a complex interaction of many MUAPs.
&nbsp;The amplitude of this noisy signal increases as the muscle
becomes active and remains quiet when the muscle is relaxed.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Diagram (A) on
the right shows recordings from the biceps and triceps during a slow
isometric elbow flexion. &nbsp;The flexor muscle (Biceps) becomes
very active while the extensor (Triceps) remains quiet. There is a
small amount of activity in the triceps which could be a small
antagonistic co-contraction or it could also be crosstalk from the
Biceps.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> &nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Diagram (B) on
the right shows a rapid elbow flexion-extension movement in which there
are two bursts of activity in the flexor and a single burst in the
extensor. &nbsp;Notice that in a coordinated movement, the
antagonist muscle is quiet when the agonist is active.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Kinesiologists
use EMG to identify which muscles are involved in different movements
and how the timing of the activations relate to skilled movements.
&nbsp;When two antagonistic muscles are active at the same time, it
is called a "Co-contraction" and is often seen with stroke patients and
others with neuromuscular disorders.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">EMG to
Activation:</font></p>
<p><img src="EMG4.jpg" align="right" height="500" width="300"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Quite often,
the
kinesiologist not only needs to know when a muscle is active, but how
active it is.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The diagram to
the
right shows the raw EMG (top) of an isometrically contracting muscle.
There is a large burst of activity followed by a smaller burst.
&nbsp;We might think that the first burst is larger than the second
but how do we measure how much more active it is?</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The amount
of
activity is estimated by a process that
involves
the Full Wave Rectification of the raw signal . This process take the
absolute value of each data point (middle diagram). &nbsp;This step
is necessary because a simple average of the bursts would yield a value
of zero because each action potential has an average value of zero due
to the depolarization and repolarization of each fiber.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Once
the signal
has been full wave rectified, we smooth the signal with a lowpass
filter that mimics the process of converting action potentials to
twitches of muscle force (bottom diagram).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The resulting
signal shows that the first burst is indeed larger than the second.
&nbsp;Researchers have found that this process yields a signal that
closely resembles the active state of the muscle and also the amount of
force that the muscle exerts under isometric, non-fatigued conditions.</font></p>

<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;" align="left"><big>&nbsp;Calibration:</big></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The smooth
rectified EMG can be calibrated to isometric muscle force by having a
subject perform isometric contractions between zero and their Maximum
Voluntary Contraction (MVC), plotting the values for the EMG vs the
force values and calculating a line of best fit (see below).

<p><img src="EMG6.jpg" align="right" height="302" width="400"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The
relationship is often linear and can be described by a
straight line of best fit but sometimes a nonlinear best fitting line
is required. &nbsp;The figure on the right shows the EMG to force
relationship for three muscles. &nbsp;It can be seen that the First
Dorsal Interoseous muscle (FDI) has a more linear relationship than
Deltoid or Biceps.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Since the
relationship is muscle and subject specific, investigtors often
perform a simple calibration trial in which the subject gradually
increases and decreases their effort while the force and EMG is
monitored. &nbsp;The figure below shows a typical result of such a
ramp isometric contraction. &nbsp;The smoothed, rectified EMG is
plotted against the force and a best fitting equation is fitted to the
data. &nbsp;Notice that the relationship is fairly smooth and
nearly linear. &nbsp;Also notice that when the muscle reaches high
levels of activation, the EMG is a lot more variable than the force.
&nbsp;For this reason, it is not advised to use an MVC to calibrate
EMG to force.&nbsp;</font></p>
