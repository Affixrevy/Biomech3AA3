<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A wedge is also
considered to be a simple machine. It can be very useful to lift heavy
objects a short distance. Friction is a key component to prevent the
wedge from slipping out from underneath the heavy object after the
force is no longer applied.</font></p>

<p><img src="pulley12.jpg" align="right" height="305" width="300"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">As an example, consider the heavy block shown to
the right. A wedge can be used to lift the 1000 N block by applying
force P to the wedge. In order to determine the amount of force
required, we must consider the friction forces as well as gravity.
Assume the coefficient of friction between all contacting surfaces is
0.2 and the mass of the wedge is negligible.</font></p>

<p><img src="pulley13.jpg" align="left" height="750" width="475"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Our first step is to draw a free body diagram of
the 1000 N block. We include the force of gravity (1000 N), the
friction force opposing the block sliding up the wall(F<sub>1</sub>),
the normal
force of the wall acting on the block (N<sub>1</sub>), the
friction force opposing
the wedge sliding along the bottom of the block (F<sub>2</sub>),
and the normal
force of the wedge acting on the block (N<sub>2</sub>).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can see that we have four unknowns and if we try
to solve this static equilibrium problem, we will only have two
equations. We can reduce our unknowns by using the friction formula (F
= &mu;.N) which means the F<sub>1</sub> = 0.2N<sub>1</sub>
and F<sub>2</sub> = 0.2N<sub>2</sub>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can now solve
for the unknown forces by taking
the sum of the horizontal and vertical components to be zero. We use
equation [1] substituting for F<sub>1</sub> to get N<sub>1</sub>
as a function of N<sub>2</sub>. We then
substitute for F<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>1</sub>
in equation [2] to find the normal force acting on the
block by the wedge needs to be 1214 N in order to overcome gravity and
friction to start motion of the block.</font></p>

<p><img src="pulley14.jpg" align="right" height="620" width="410"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to find P,&nbsp;we must also draw a
free
body diagram of the wedge.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The wedge will have the reaction force of the block
(F<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>) acting in the
opposite directions (Newton's third law), the
applied force (P), the friction force of the floor opposing the sliding
of the wedge (F<sub>3</sub>) and the normal force of the
floor acting on the wedge
(N<sub>3</sub>).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Again, we write the two static equilibrium
equations and substitute the known values for N<sub>2</sub>
and F<sub>2</sub> to solve for N<sub>3</sub>
and then P. Notice that P = 796 N is less than the 1000 N gravitational
force acting on the block. This means that the wedge has offered a
force advantage even though it must also overcome friction in order to
cause the block to move.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If we used a heavy hammer to deliver blows that had
forces in excess of 796 N, the block would be lifted. What happens when
we stop hammering? Why does the wedge not slip back out when P = 0?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to answer that question, we would re-draw
our free body diagrams without P and since the impending motion due to
gravity would be opposite, we would reverse the direction of the three
frictional forces. F<sub>1</sub> would oppose the block
sliding downward and even though N<sub>2</sub> would still
be tending to push the wedge out, F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>3</sub>
will be more than sufficient to keep the wedge in place. This is mostly
due to the slight angle (15<sup>o</sup>) and the
coefficient of friction (&mu; = 0.2). Without friction, the wedge could
not remain supporting the block and if the angle is too steep for a
given coefficient of friction, the wedge will also slip back out.</font></p>
