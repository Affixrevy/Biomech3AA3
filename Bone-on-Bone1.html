Forces vs Joint Reaction Forces</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In&nbsp;previous
lectures, we used Newton's second law and&nbsp;free body diagrams
to find the net joint moments and joint reaction forces. Click <a
 href="dynamic1.html">dynamic equilibrium</a>
and <a href="Linked1.html">
linked segment mechanics</a> if you
wish to review.
The net joint moments were very helpful for the interpretation of the
causes of human motion but the net joint moments were not very good
estimates of the actual stresses within human articulations.
&nbsp;The reason for this is that the muscles were simplified to a
single net joint moment actuator. &nbsp;The example below shows
this difference using the elbow joint in static equilibrium.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The diagram to
the right shows a person holding an 80 N weight in his hand.
&nbsp;We would like to know the net joint moment and joint reaction
forces required to maintain this position in static
equilibrium.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to
determine the internal kinetics, our first step is to draw a free body
diagram of the forearm and hand segment. The rigid body is acted upon
by the gravitational forces of the segment's mass (30N), the applied
load (80N) the net joint moment representing all the tissues crossing
the joint (M) and the joint reactions forces in the X and Y
directions.</font></p>
<p><img src="Bone-on-Bone2.jpg" align="left" height="370" width="600"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The second step
is to use the three equations of static equilibrium to solve for the
joint reaction forces and net joint moment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can see in
the solution to the left that the net joint moment is 17.6 N.m and that
the horizontal reaction force is 0 N and the vertical reaction force is
110N.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This result
assumed that the muscles crossing the elbow joint could be represented
by the pure torque generator (M).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Bone-on-Bone3.jpg" align="right" height="440" width="400"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We
know that muscles are
not pure torque generators. &nbsp;We know that a muscle is better
represented by a linear force actuator pulling from origin to insertion
(or vice versa depending on the segment of interest). &nbsp;Let's
re-examine this situation given a single muscle that exerts a force (F)
acting on the segment with the coordinates shown to the right.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Bone-on-Bone4.jpg" align="left" height="400" width="320"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The free body
diagram is similar. &nbsp;The only difference is that the net joint
moment (M) has been replaced with the actual muscle force (F) and the
same equations of static equilibrium are used.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Bone-on-Bone5.jpg" align="right" height="440" width="460"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">However, the
joint
reaction forces are quite different. The muscle force required to keep
the forearm in static equilibrium was 716 N. &nbsp;This is
considerably
larger than the 110N gravitational force. &nbsp;This is to be
expected
because the moment arm of the muscle is much shorter than moment arms
of the load and segment mass. &nbsp;The consequence of this large
muscle force is that it compresses the forearm into the humerus and
tends to shear it anteriorly as well.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">These
bone-on-bone
forces of 603 N in the vertical and 62.4 N in the horizontal are closer
to the
real situation than the joint reaction forces calculated above.
&nbsp;The reason that we do not normally do these calculations is
that
in reality, we do not have accurate insertion distances of muscles and
exact angles of the muscle force direction. &nbsp;An even greater
problem is that there are several muscles crossing the joint and our
equations of equilibrium only allow the calculation of one
unknown.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A more accurate
model would include all of the muscles crossing the elbow joint such as
the biceps (F<sub>1</sub>),
Brachialis (F<sub>2</sub>),
and the
Brachioradialis (F<sub>3</sub>)
shown in
the diagram below. &nbsp;In this situation, we would have five
unknowns (F<sub>1</sub>,
F<sub>2</sub>,
F<sub>3</sub>,
R<sub>x</sub>,
and R<sub>y</sub>)
and only three equations.
&nbsp;This is known as the "Indeterminacy Problem" and is the main
reason that most linked segment mechanics uses the net joint moment
rather than individual muscle forces. &nbsp;The next lecture looks
at
possible solutions to the indeterminacy problem.</font></p>
