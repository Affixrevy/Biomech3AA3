<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the previous
lectures,
we assumed that joints allowed rotations about a fixed axis in an
anatomical plane (sagittal, frontal , or transverse). These
"geometrically ideal" joints are used often in biomechanics when
examining gross motor tasks such as walking, running, whole body
occupational and sports tasks, etc. However, no human joint is
geometrically ideal and this lecture looks more closely at the true
nature of joints and joint motion.

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"><big>Joint Surfaces:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The articular surfaces of joints are not flat.
They have a curvature that is either concave or convex. The two mating
articular surfaces are labeled as male (convex) and female (concave).
Examples of geometrically ideal joints are shown on the right. The
ball-and-socket joint moves in three planes (hip, shoulder), the saddle
joint moves in two planes (carpals, tarsals and phalanges), and the
hinge joint moves in one plane (elbow, knee).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The surface curvature is not geometrically ideal
in actual joints and the&nbsp;incongruity between the surfaces
&nbsp;reduces the contact areas and therefore increases the contact
pressure. Large local stress can damage articular cartilage and lead to
joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and bursitis.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><img src="JointKinematics2.jpg" align="right" height="280" width="340"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The&nbsp;congruence of two joint surfaces is
measured by mapping the surface curvature of the male and female ends
of the bones and calculating the difference (see &Delta; in the
diagram). &nbsp;The &Delta; values are calculated over the
range of
motion and a single value is assigned from the root means square (RMS).
The smaller the value of &Delta;, the higher the degree of
congruence.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Ateshian, et al. (1992) examined the congruence of
the thumb Carpometacarpal joints in
men and women because it was known that women have a greater prevalence
of osteoarthritis than men. Their results showed that women had
significantly less congruent joint surfaces. This may indicate that
under similar loading conditions during occupational tasks such as
pinching and grasping, women
may experience higher stress and increased risk of joint disease.</font></p>

<p><img src="JointKinematics3.jpg" align="right" height="307" width="600"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Since joints are not geometrically ideal, the
level
of congruency changes throughout the range of motion. The figure to the
right shows the glenohermeral joint at maximum congruency when the arm
is fully abducted (left) and becomes less congruent as the arm is
adducted (right). When the humerus is abducted and the male surface is
in contact with the female surface at each point (fully congruent), the
position is called "close-packed". When less than fully congruent, the
position is called "loose-packed".</font></p>

<p><img src="KneeXray.gif" align="left" height="264" width="266"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Joint motion has two classifications. The two
surfaces can be rolling or sliding past each other and in most joints
the motion is a combination of both. The movie on left is a
fluoroscopic (moving Xray) capture of a healthy human knee joint of a
man performing a lunge. As he lunges forward and his knee moves into
flexion, we can see the femur rolling over the top of the tibia.
However, it is also sliding forward so the femur does not roll off the
back of the tibia. This is also seen in the shoulder and other joints.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="JointKinematics4a.jpg" align="right" height="294" width="382"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The relative amounts of rolling and sliding is
called the "slip ratio". Referring to the diagram on the right,
consider a point on the concave surface where the two articulating
bones touch in the fully extended joint and call this point "a". Also,
consider a point on the convex surface when the two bones touch in the
fully flexed position and call this point "c". Finally, locate a point
on the concave surface where the two bones touch when the joint is
fully flexed and call this point "b". The slip ratio for this range is
calculated as the ratio of the arc length from a to b (represented by
the red line) divided by the arc length from a to c (represented by the
green line).&nbsp;A ratio of 1
occurs when the two arc lengths are equal which represents pure
rolling. A ratio occurs when the arc length from a to b is zero and
this represents
pure slipping.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In an ideal hinge, the male surface would spin
inside a
close-packed female surface of the same curvature and the slip ratio
would be zero. The
slip ratio can be calculated for smaller ranges of joint motion and can
change throughout the range of joint motion. The amount of slipping and
rolling depends
on the shapes of the male and female surfaces as well as the
constraints of the ligaments (see 4-bar linkage discussion below). When
reconstructing the ACL with a graft, it is important to use the same
length and attachment points as the original ligament to prevent
permanent sliding with the same contact point on the tibial surface
which could lead to excessive wear at that point.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Codman's paradox is a sequence of shoulder
rotations that produce a rotation about the long axis of the humerus
without performing axial rotation. Using the figure on the right and
assuming the individual starts with their arm hanging down at their
side with their palm facing backward (thumb pointing medially). Now the
person performs forward flexion (90<sup>o</sup>
rotation about the negative X-axis), &nbsp;followed by horizontal
extension (90<sup>o</sup> rotation about the positive
Y-axis) and finally adduction (90<sup>o</sup> degree
rotation about the negative Z-axis). The final position has the thumb
pointing anteriorly and a 90 degree rotation has been performed about
the long axis without ever performing the lateral rotation. If you
repeat this sequence again, your thumb will be pointing laterally.<br>

Infraspinatus is a major lateral rotator of the shoulder but we could
achieve lateral rotation without using that muscle if we followed
Codman's paradox.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Codman's paradox is not really a paradox because
joint angular rotations are not commutative. Rotation about X plus
rotation about Z is not equal to rotation about Z plus rotation about
X. However, it is important to know the different strategies that can
be employed to achieve various movements in order to decide which is
the most beneficial.</font></p>

<p><img src="FourBarLinkage.gif" align="left" height="264" width="266"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Articular motion is not only governed by the
geometry of the joint and the articulating surfaces but also by the
ligaments. The knee joint is a classic example of how the rolling and
sliding motion is governed by the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and
the posterior collateral ligament (PCL). The fluoroscopic capture above
is shown on the right with a four bar linkage system representing the
femur, tibia, ACL and PCL. The red dot at the intersection of the two
ligaments shows the center of rotation. We tend to think that the role
of
the ACL is to prevent anterior dislocation of the tibia and the PCL
prevents posterior dislocation. In addition to these roles, these
ligaments define the motion of the knee joint. We can see that the
center of rotation is not a fixed point within the male surface as
would be the case for an ideal hinge joint.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Orthopedic surgeons take great care to position
tendon grafts as close as possible to the original attachments so as
not to alter the joint moment. Manufacturers of artificial joint
replacement prostheses also incorporate four-bar linkages and other
couplings to simulate the non-ideal joints that are being
replaced.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">We have previously
calculated the moment of force caused by a muscle crossing a joint. In
static equilibrium we used the moment arm as the perpendicular distance
between the line of action of the muscle and the joint axis. In 3-D
moments we used the cross product of the force and the position vector
which was considered to the displacement from the axis of rotation to
the point of force application. In both cases, we assumed a fixed
center of rotation as the axis which is not always correct.</span></big></p>

<p><img src="JointKinematics8.jpg" align="right" height="372" width="600"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">When a rigid body moves through space, it has an
instant center of rotation (ICR) that can be calculated if we have two
identifiable points on the body. The figure to the right shows two
methods of calculating the ICR. The tangent method uses the
instantaneous velocities of the two points and then finds the
intersection of their normals. The Reuleaux method uses the finite
displacements of the two points and then finds the intersection of
perpendicular lines drawn from the midpoints of those displacements.
Mathematically, both methods are correct but in practice, both are
prone to large errors with very small errors in displacement. Also, the
ICR path can be quite different under loading conditions when compared
to unloaded or passive movement. In spite of errors, when great care is
taken to
measure the ICR accurately, it can be a good diagnostic tool to compare
a pathological joint with a healthy joint.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Conclusion:&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We assume ideal joints when calculating joint
reaction forces and net joint moments. The fact that many joints are
not ideal joints does not not affect those calculations appreciably.
However, when we need to look closely at the joint, the structural
differences may influence our decisions even if the magnitudes of the
forces and moments do not change.</font></p>
