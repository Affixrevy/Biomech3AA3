  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> Kinematics are variables 
    that describe motion. Motion is the act or process of changing place or position 
    with respect to some reference point. Kinematic variables include displacement, 
    velocity and acceleration. The previous lectures have discussed forces in 
    static equilibrium that prevent motion and also friction that tends to oppose 
    motion. We now look more closely at motion and kinematics.</font ></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Linear motion occurs when 
    every part of the body travels through the same distance, in the same direction, 
    and in the same time. This is also called translation.</font ></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The ski jumper who remains 
    in the same posture as he travels down a constant slope from A to B is an 
    example of translation or linear motion.</font>
  <p align="left">&nbsp; 
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We have used the XY axis 
    system to define two orthogonal directions of forces and we can also use it 
    to describe changes in position or displacement.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The skier's head has changed 
    from an initial position of (2.8,3.5) to a final position of (4.7,2.4). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The displacement in the 
    X direction is calculated by subtracting the initial X position from the final 
    X position</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&Delta; X = 4.7 - 2.8 = 
    1.9</font> </p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The displacement in the 
    Ydirection is calculated by subtracting the initial Y position from the final 
    Y position</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&Delta; Y = 2.4 - 3.5 = 
    -1.1</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Displacement is the vector 
    quantity that describes an object's change in position so we use <a href="trig1.html">trigonometry </a>to 
    calculate the resultant magnitude (r) and direction (&Theta;) of the displacement
    of the skier's head.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Distance describes the total 
    distance traveled by the object. If there is no change in direction, displacement 
    and distance are the same. However, as soon as the object changes direction, 
    distance will be greater than displacement. Find the displacement and the 
    distance using the diagram on the right of a person who walks 5 km north, 
    then 3 km east and finally 1 km south.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Solution:</font></p>
  <img src="linear5.jpg" width="360" height="250" align="right"> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The distance walked by the 
    person is 9 km (5 + 3 + 1 = 9) but since the direction changed, the displacement 
    will be different than the distance. In this case, the person was displaced 
    4 km north (5 - 1) and 3 km east. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The resultant displacement 
    (r) is 5 km in the direction of 53.1 degrees north of east.</font></p>
