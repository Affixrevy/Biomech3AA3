is Biomechanics:</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="+2"> </font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>I
have found it necessary to have two definitions of the biomechanics of
human motion. One definition is an operational definition that clearly
defines the field of study and serves as a guide to those of us
studying and working in the field and the other definition is a less
technical definition that is more easily understood by the lay person.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#800000" face="MS Sans Serif" size="4"><u><font color="#008000">Operational Definition</font></u>
Biomechanics of human motion is the study of the effects and control of
forces that act on and are produced by the human body.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif"> <b>The
central word is "forces" which are the fundamental causes of motion and
reminds us that we need to be concerned with kinetics (causes) as well
as kinematics (descriptions). The forces that "act on" the human body
are external forces such as gravity and the reactions of the ground and
other objects. Forces that are "produced by" the human body are
internal forces such as muscle, ligament and joint forces. The
"control" aspect to the definition reminds us that we need to be
concerned with neuromuscular control.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000" face="MS Sans Serif" size="4"><u>Lay
Definition</u></font><font color="#800000" face="MS Sans Serif" size="4">
Biomechanics of human motion is the application of the laws of physics
to improve the safety and performance of workers, athletes, and
clinical populations such as amputees, children with cerebral palsy,
and many others.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif"> <b>This
definition is more vague but it is better understood by lay people and
the inclusion of some common applications emphasizes its importance to
those who would not otherwise make the association.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>From
the definition of biomechanics, it follows that
one needs to have a solid understanding of the mechanics of human
motion. The level of understanding is reflected by the ability to solve
a vast array of applied problems. Solutions to applied problems require
tools such as math, physics, and engineering techniques because the <font color="#008000">solutions are often contrary to our
common sense</font>. Common sense
might cause one to think that if I can perform a single somersault from
a 2 meter platform, I should be able to perform a double somersault
from a four meter platform because I will be in the air for twice as
long. However, those who know the physics of projectiles and the law of
gravity know that height is proportional to the square of time and that
I really need a height that is four times larger to allow me twice as
long in the air. Click <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/%7Edet/phy2060/heavyboots.html">here</a>
to read of other common misconceptions of our physical world.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>How
is it possible that we can live our entire lives in an environment that
is controlled by physical laws and yet most of us have a very poor
understanding of those laws and their consequences? I think that at
least part of the answer has to do with the fact that visually, we
perceive displacement and velocity but not acceleration. Acceleration
is proportional to the forces causing motion but the kinematics that we
perceive (displacement and velocity) are nonlinearly related to the
kinetics that cause motion and we are not very good at thinking
nonlinearly (most of us, anyway). In addition to being contrary to
common sense, <font color="#008000">the
first step to solving an applied problem is usually the most difficult
step</font>. The result, like much
of mathematics is a frustrating feeling that problems seem impossible
to solve until a light is mysteriously turned on and then the solutions
seem elementary.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#800000" face="MS Sans Serif" size="4">How
is the light "turned on"?</font><font face="MS Sans Serif">
</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b>Most
math, physics and engineering textbooks provide the theory of a certain
topic followed by an example of a solved problem and then provide
several "exercise problems". The answers to the exercise problems are
usually but not always given. It is implied that, although frustrating,
mastery of the topic is best achieved by struggling with the exercise
problems until the light is "turned on". It is my opinion that this has
resulted in a dichotomy in our society between a minority who can do
math and physics, and the majority who cannot. This frustration causes
students to withdraw from math oriented studies and to remain
under confident and unskilled in applied problem solving. Since
solutions to these sorts of problems (and understanding) often requires
overcoming common sense and since hard work is not a guarantee that the
light will be "turned on", there is a belief by many in our society
that you must be born with an aptitude for math and physics in order to
be successful. Those with this belief use it as an excuse for their
lack of skill in these areas and some even go so far as to claim that
boys are better at math than girls and that certain ethnic groups have
an advantage or disadvantage. Research has failed to find any genetic
or biological cause and the reasons for any difference can only be
considered to be cultural at this time. Click <a href="http://www.campbell-kibler.com/no_virginia.htm">here</a>
for
more information on the lack of women and various ethnic groups in
the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering. The bottom line is
that whatever differences may exist between genders or cultures, I
believe those differences can be eliminated with proper attitudes and
training. I hope that these lectures provide the proper training to
students with the proper attitude. For the student, it is therefore
important to believe that any problem can be solved and that there are
no barriers of any kind.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="MS Sans Serif">It
is clear to me that a
better
method of learning applied problem solving and, as a consequence,
gaining a better understanding of math, science, and engineering is
needed. The method needs to be delivered in a way that overcomes
gender, racial and other cultural barriers and needs to have a stronger
relationship between hard work and success and have less frustration
getting started. I have developed a method of teaching called <a href="DST.html">Smart Tutor&trade;</a>
with these goals in mind and it is my hope that this will allow the
light to be "turned on" for the majority of our society rather than the
minority.</font></b></p>
