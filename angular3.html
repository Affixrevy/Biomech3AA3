  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> </font ><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">It 
    is important to be able to convert degrees to radians and vice versa. Consider 
    an angular displacement (&theta;) in which the arc length of the circular 
    path (s) is equal to the radius of the circular path (r). Since one revolution 
    is 360&deg; and the circumference of a circle is 2&pi;r,<br>
    </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1"> 1 rad = 360&deg; / 2&pi; = 57.3&deg;</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">So a radian is a unitless 
    ratio of the arc length (l) to the radius (r) and it is equivalent to 57.3&deg;. 
    We will see that this unitless expression of angular displacement is very 
    important to the kinematics and kinetics of human motion. We can convert from 
    degrees to radians by dividing by 57.3 and we can convert from radian to degrees 
    by multiplying by 57.3.</font>

    often need to know the linear parameters of various points on a body that 
    is rotating. For example, the linear motion of the hand depends upon the angular 
    motion of the upper limb. Although a particle on a rotating body is following 
    a circular path, at any particular instant, its velocity is tangent to the 
    path and it has a linear velocity called tangential velocity (Vt).</font >

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> The rate of change of tangential 
    velocity is tangential acceleration.</font ></p>
  <img src="angular13.jpg" width="280" height="300" align="center">
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since tangential velocity 
    is a vector that has a continuously changing direction, there must be an acceleration 
    associated with it. This acceleration is at 90 degrees to the tangential acceleration 
    projected along the radius toward the axis of rotation and is called the radial 
    acceleration.</font ></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The total linear acceleration 
    is the vector sum of the tangential and radial acceleration.</font ></p>
