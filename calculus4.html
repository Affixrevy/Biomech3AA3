<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Another very useful application of calculus is to
solve problems that seek an optimal solution. When a function is at
a&nbsp;maximum value, its slope is zero. Similarly, when a function
is at a minimum value, its slope is also zero. This means that if we
can find the derivative of a function (slope) and solve for when it is
zero, we can tell exactly when it is at a maximum or minimum. For
instance, if we were asked when the maximum displacement occurred given
displacement = -t<sup>3</sup> + 6t<sup>2</sup>,
we find the derivative of the displacement function and solve for t
when the derivative = 0. In this case, the derivative would be velocity
and v = -3t<sup>2</sup> + 12t. Solving for t when 0 = -3t<sup>2</sup>+12t,
yields t = 4. If we substitute the value of 4 into the original
equation, we will find the maximum displacement is exactly 32.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We
know that if we drag a box across the floor, the horizontal component
of the pulling force (P) must be equal to the friction force. The
friction force is the product of the coefficient of friction (&mu;)
and
the normal force. If we pull the box at an angle &theta;, the
vertical
component reduces the normal force which reduces the friction forces
and requires less of a pulling force (P). What is the optimum angle
(&theta;)
that reduces P to a minimum?</font></p>

<p><img src="calculus15.jpg" align="left" height="270" width="660"> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We
can see from the calculations to the left, that the larger the
denominator (cos&theta; + &mu;sin&theta;), the smaller the
pulling force (P). Therefore, if we can maximize the denominator, we
will minimize P.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">To find the ideal angle that requires the least
pulling force, we need to maximize the denominator.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In order to maximize the denominator, we
differentiate the denominator with respect to &theta; and set the
derivative to
zero. Now, when we solve for&nbsp;&theta;, we will have the
angle that minimizes the pulling force.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="calculus17.jpg" align="left" height="244" width="332"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Notice that the optimum angle only depends on the
coefficient of friction between the box and the floor (&mu;). The
angle does not depend on the size or weight of the box which means that
the person should adjust the angle down if the surface friction is
reduced and increase the angle if the surface becomes more rough.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Also notice the posture of the person pulling the
box. The angle that requires the least amount of force may not be ideal
for the person pulling the box. This is a fundamental difference
between engineering and biomechanics because the human factor must be
considered in addition to laws of physics and engineering principles.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Therefore, if we can find the derivative of a
function, we can find an optimum or ideal result. This is quite
important
in biomechanics because we would like to know the best way of doing
something, or the least risk of injury, etc.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"><u>Product, Quotient and Chain Rules</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Quite often, the function is not a polynomial or
simple trigonometric function. In some cases the function is a
combination of other functions that cannot be expressed as a single
polynomial.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">For example, consider the ski jumper who knows
that air resistance places a drag force that is proportional to his
angle of attack (&beta;) that will slow his motion. He also knows
that he can create lift with an
angle of attack which help him travel further. Since lift can only be
achieved at the expense of
drag, he must find the angle of attack that has the highest
lift-to-drag ratio. Wind tunnel testing has revealed the lift (L) and
drag (D) equations as functions of the attack angle (&beta;). In
order to
find the maximum ratio, we must differentiate the L/D function and
solve for &beta; when the derivative is 0.</font></p>

<p><img src="calculus18.jpg" align="middle" height="453" width="1000"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In this case, we used the quotient rule. Other
important rules are the product rule and the chain rule. As a
reference, here are these rules where h(x) is the equation to be
differentiated and is composed of equation f(x) and g(x).</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"><u>Newton-Raphson Method</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The Newton-Raphson method is a very powerful tool
that allows us to solve algebraic equations that are
difficult/impossible to factor. For example, if we needed to find the
value for x in the equation 0 =&nbsp;x<sup>3</sup>
+&nbsp;x - 5, we would need to factor or isolate x on one side of a
solvable algebraic equation. This is not possible and the term
transcendental equation is used to describe these equations. However,
there is an iterative approach&nbsp;called the "Newton-Raphson
method" that can yield a result that approaches an exact solution. The
method requires that we can differentiate the original equation. The
figure below shows the method starting with an initial guess of x = 1
and using the function and the derivative to make successive guesses
that approach the final solution of 1.51598 that is within six decimal places of the exact result.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Bottom Line:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Calculus is a tool that biomechanists can use when
we wish to determine kinematic variables like displacement, velocity,
and acceleration. It is very useful in optimization cases and many
other applications of biomechanics. Like all tools, the better our
skill at using the tool, the more effective we can be. This lecture is
in no way a complete review of calculus and the serious biomechanist
may need to explore more advanced aspects of calculus such as partial
differential equations (&part;y/&part;x) and numerical methods
of solving differential
equations. However, this brief exploration of calculus should enable a
clear understanding of functions and how biomechanists use them.</font></p>
