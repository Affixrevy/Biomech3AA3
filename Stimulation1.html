Stimulation of Muscle</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Myo-electric
stimulation is the electrical stimulation of muscle. &nbsp;An
important
application is the functional electrical stimulation (FES) which
elicits contraction of paralyzed muscle. &nbsp;Before we look at
the
various applications of myo-electric stimulation, we will examine how
it
is achieved.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Methods of
stimulation:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Nerve</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Percutaneous</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The figure below
shows a situation of two pairs of small electrodes over the external
obliques and a large pair of larer
electrodes over the rectus abdominus.</font></p>

Control:</font></p>
<p><img src="Stimulation2.jpg" align="right" height="344" width="395"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The stimulator
uses a very short pulse (0.1ms) and varies the intensity with a voltage
adjustment and a frequency adjustment. Increasing the voltage recruits
more fibers and increasing the frequency increases the firing rate of
the recruited fibers. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">
The force of muscle contraction is
therefore modulated similarly to the way the central nervouse system
uses recruitment and firing rate to modulate force (see the <a
 href="musclemech1.html">Muscle Mechanics
</a> lecture for more detail). However, there are some important
differences
between nature muscular activation and myo-electric stimulation.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Spinal Cord
Injury (FES)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Injuries to the
spinal cord result
in paralysis and a reduced ability of the central nervous system to
activate muscles. &nbsp;Myo-electric stimulation with the purpose
of activating muscle is often called functional electrical stimulation
(FES). Jerold Petrofsky became famous in the 1980s when he was able to
apply electrodes with computer controlled stimulators to a student at
Wright State University to cause her lower extremity muscles to ride a
tricycle. &nbsp;The popular news magazine TV show called "60
Minutes" broadcast the feat and Petrofsky announced that the student
would be walking by the time she graduated. &nbsp;The student's
name is Nan Davis and she was an elite skier who was injured in a car
accident during the summer before she started university. &nbsp;She
was an excellent candidate for myo-electric stimulation because she had
tremendous muscular ability before her accident and those muscles had
not atrophied as much as others who had been paralyzed for longer
periods. <br>
