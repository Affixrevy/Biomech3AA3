  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"> Calculus is a very important 
    tool for the application of biomechanics. This lecture is not a substitute 
    for a college calculus course but it is designed to introduce differential 
    and integral calculus in such a way that it can be applied to aspects of biomechanics 
    (i.e. projectiles) with no prior exposure to calculus. In order to practice 
    biomechanics at the graduate level, at least one course in calculus and another 
    in differential equations should be considered necessary. This lecture begins 
    with a review of functions and the student should already be familiar with 
    slopes and average velocity from the linear kinematics lecture.</font ></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><u>Review of Functions</u></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A property is something 
    that characterizes some things but not others. A variable is a set of mutually 
    exclusive properties. Properties on a variable are often called values. For 
    example, muscular strength is a property that characterizes the amount of 
    force that a muscle can exert but does not characterize the muscle's resistance 
    to fatigue. Force would be the variable and strong muscles would have higher 
    values of strength than weak muscles.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A function is the description 
    of one variable in terms of one or more other variables. For example, horizontal 
    displacement (x) is a variable that can be described as a function of time 
    with the following equation: x(t) = 6t + 2</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In this course, the descriptions 
    of movement (kinematic variables) will almost always be with respect to time.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Draw a graph of the function 
    x(t) = 6t + 2 from t = 0 to t = 10.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This function tells us that 
    x varies or changes when t varies or changes. If we manipulate t from 0 to 
    10 and calculate x for each change of t, we can graph the two variables. The 
    variable that we manipulate is called the &quot;independent variable&quot; 
    and the variable we measure is called the &quot;dependent variable&quot;. 
    The first step is to create a table that allows t to vary from 0 to 10 and 
    calculates values for x that corespond to each value of t.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The second step is to create 
    the graph using the values in the table. The independent variable (t) is put 
    on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable is put on the vertical axis.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The dots in the graph correspond 
    to the points that we calculated and recorded in the chart above. The solid 
    line is the continuous function that goes through the points.</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The beauty of equations 
    is that they perfectly describe the relationship between variables and we 
    will see that an ability to work with these equations will allow us to determine 
    many important facts about human motion.</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Average Velocity Revisited:</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Let us assume that x is 
    the horizontal position of an object, and t repesents time. Therefore, x(t) 
    is a function that describes how position changes with respect to time. Recall 
    that average velocity is the rate of change of position and can be calculated 
    by dividing the change in position (displacement) by the change in time. This 
    calculation is known as the slope of x(t) between two values of time.</font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Find the average velocity 
    between t=2 and t=4.</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Solution:</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">x(2) = 6(2) + 2 = 14 and 
    x(4) = 6(4) + 2 = 26</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">we use the delta sign (&Delta;) 
    to represent change which is equal to the final value minus the initial value.</font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Therefore &Delta;x = x(4) 
    - x(2) = 26 - 14 = 12 m and </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">&Delta;t 
    = 4 - 2 = 2 s</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">average velocity = &Delta;x/&Delta;t 
    = 12/ 2 = 6 m/s</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Notice that x(t) = 6t + 
    2 is an equation of a straight line which means that the slope is the same 
    at each instant in time. This also means that the velocity is 6 m/s at every 
    instant in time.</font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">How do we calculate velocity 
    when the slope is always changing?</font>
