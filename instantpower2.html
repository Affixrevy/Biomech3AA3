Patterns and Movement Outcomes</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Imagine an
experiment in which we have two toy trains. One will roll down a
straight inclined track while the other will roll down a curved track.
The clip below shows that the blue train on the curved slope reaches
the end of the track first even though it had to travel a greater
distance. Both trains start from the same height and with the same
initial velocity with only gravity causing the motion. So why did the
blue train cover the greater distance in less time?</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The blue
train has a higher initial acceleration due to the steeper initial
slope
of the curved track. This allows the blue train to gain a greater
velocity early. At T<sub>1</sub>,
the two trains have the same acceleration but the blue train has gained
more velocity and even though it has less acceleration after T<sub>1</sub>,
it covers a greater distance and reaches the bottom sooner (T<sub>2</sub>).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The black train
has a constant acceleration due to the constant slope of its inclined
path. &nbsp;It linearly gains velocity
until it reaches the bottom at T<sub>3</sub>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Both trains
achieve the
same final velocity because they started with the same potential energy
but the different acceleration paths account for the different movement
outcomes (see the graphs to the left).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">At the top of
the hill, the blue train had the greater acceleration, and at the
bottom of the hill, the black train had the greater acceleration and we
can see that this difference changes the way the trains move. Dowling
(1992) showed that different acceleration paths for human movement had
even greater significance when the movement is constrained by the range
of motion.</font></p>
<p><img src="instantpower3.jpg" align="left" height="533" width="300"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;<br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
graphs to the left show two
patterns
of motion of a hand segment extending from the shoulder similar to a
shot put or boxing punch. In each case, the hand moves forward
by 1 meter at which point the elbow would be fully extended and no
further
acceleration is possible at the end of the range of motion. The
movement represented by the
solid line accelerates rapidly, achieving a final velocity of 2 m/s in
about 0.8 seconds. &nbsp;The movement represented by the dashed
line doesn't reach maximum acceleration until late in the movement,
achieves a higher final velocity (about 2.4 m/s) but takes almost a
full second to reach the full range.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Both movement
have the same maximum acceleration and would require the same amount of
force. &nbsp;The pattern that reaches maximum acceleration early in
the movement has the shorter movement time and would be desired by a
boxer. &nbsp;The pattern that reaches maximum acceleration late in
the movement has the higher final velocity and would be desired by the
shot putter.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It seems that
motor learning is all that is required to produce the desired pattern
for a given task. &nbsp;However, that is not the case and a closer
examination of the power of these two strategies reveals the dependence
of ballistic performance on
instantaneous power.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="instantpower4.jpg" align="left" height="533" width="300"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;<br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
graphs to the left show the
same patterns as above. &nbsp;In each case, the acceleration has
been
multiplied by mass to yield force (top graph). &nbsp;The force
values
were then multiplied by the velocity values (middle graph) to yield the
instantaneous powers which are plotted in the bottom graph.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It can be seen
that
the pattern associated with the short movement time (peak forces early
in the movement) requires considerably less power than the pattern
associated with the high final velocity (peak force late in the
movement). &nbsp;Impulsive or ballistic movements that require high
final velocities and are limited by the range of motion such as the
shot put or vertical jump require large instantaneous power generation.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Adamson and
Whitney
were correct to assert the importance of performance on the amount of
impulse but they overlooked the requirement of instantaneous power to
achieve that impulse. &nbsp;The area under the force-time curve of
the
dashed line in the top graph is indeed greater than the area under the
solid line. &nbsp;This results in the greater velocity (middle
graph)
but would not have been possible without the dramatically greater power
shown in the lower graph.</font></p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In conclusion,
the
vertical jump test is a good measure of peak leg power and athletes
competing in ballistic events should attempt to increase peak power in
order to improve performance just as the distance runner should try to
increase oxidative capacity.</font></p>
