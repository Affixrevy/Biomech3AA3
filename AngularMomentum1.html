Momentum of a Linked Segment System</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Angular momentum
was introduced in a previous lecture (<a href="Impulse2.html">Impulse-Momentum</a>).
&nbsp;Angular momentum about a given axis is calculated as the
product
of moment of inertia and the angular velocity of the segment.
&nbsp;It
is not so simple in a system of rigid links because the links can move
somewhat independently of each other. &nbsp;The angular momentum
about
a certain axis is the sum of each segment's angular momentum about that
axis. &nbsp;The calculation of each segment's angular momentum
consists
of the angular momentum about its CofG (local term) and a remote term
(often called the transfer term)
that relates the segment's angular momentum about the axis of interest.

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The diagram to
the
right shows a single segment in which the angular momentum about the
proximal
end can be calculated as the product of the moment of inertia about the
proximal end and the segment angular velocity.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another way to
calculate the angular momentum would be to take the product of the
moment of inertia about the CofG with segment angular velocity plus the
product of mass with the cross product of linear velocity and the
position vector from axis to CofG. &nbsp;In the case of a single
segment, the second method is not required&nbsp;but in
multi-segment systems, it is essential to calculate the angular
momentum of the system about a given axis.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example of a single segment:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The segment has a mass of 2 kg and the CofG is
0.125 m from the axis at the proximal end. The moment of inertia of the
segment about the CofG is 0.01042 kg.m2. Find the angular moment of the
segment about the proximal end if the angular velocity is 10 rad/s.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The first method calculates the moment of inertia
about the proximal end and then multiplies that moment of inertia times
the angular velocity to get the angular momentum about P.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The second method calculates the local term as the
moment of inertia about the CofG (0.0104 kg.m<sup>2</sup>)
and multiplies that by the angular velocity of 10 rad/s. It then
calculates the remote or transfer term as the mass times the cross
product of the radial distance from the axis (r) with the linear
velocity of the CofG. In this case, the linear velocity of the CofG is
the tangential velocity. The terms are added together to get the
angular momentum about P.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Notice that we get the same answer of 0.4167 kg.m<sup>2</sup>/s
with either method. This will always be the case for a single segment
but
we must use the second method when two or more segments are linked
together but can move independently.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The diagram to the left
shows a two segment system.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The angular
momentum about the proximal
end (P) can be calculated by using method 2 (above). That is, taking
the total of the local and transfer angular momentum terms of all of
the&nbsp;segments in the linked system In this case, S would be 2
because there are two segments in the system.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The example on the right shows the top view of a
person swinging their arm horizontally.
&nbsp;Both segments
have a mass of 2 kg located in the middle of the links which are 0.25 m
in length.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The calculation
of the angular momentum about the
shoulder involves the summation of the local and transfer (remote)
terms of the
two segments.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The radial
distance of segment 1 (r<sub>1</sub>)
is always 0.125 m and the radial distance of segment 2 (r<sub>2</sub>)
from the shoulder depends on the elbow angle. &nbsp;The linear
velocity of segment 1 (V<sub>1</sub>)
is the tangential velocity of the CofG of segment 1 and the linear
velocity of segment 2 (V<sub>2</sub>)
is the sum of the tangential velocity of the elbow about the shoulder
and tangential velocity of the CofG of the forearm about the elbow.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The cross
product can be calculated using rectangular components
of the radial distance and linear velocity.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="AngularMomentum4.jpg" align="left" height="420" width="850"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The total angular
momentum about the shoulder is 2.19 kg.m<sup>2</sup>/s.
&nbsp;Notice
that the transfer term of the forearm is the greatest contributor to
the angular momentum</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the "<a href="Impulse1.html">Impulse-Momentum</a>"
lecture
in&nbsp;Biomechanics II, we saw that impulse was equal to a change
in momentum. Therefore. angular impulse is equal to a change in angular
momentum. Angular impulse is also equal to a moment of force or torque
times time.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order for the two segment system shown above to
have 2.19 kg.m<sup>2</sup>/s of angular impulse, muscles
must have generated moments of force for a period of time.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The units for angular impulse are N.m.s and 1 N.m.s
= 1 kg.m<sup>2</sup>/s.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the previous
lecture on <a href="forward1.html">forward dynamics</a>,
we selected a joint moment of 4.0 N.m about joint 2 (the elbow joint)
for 0.1 seconds and
then
allowed
the system to move under its own momentum.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can see in the table on the left that
the
joint moment caused
accelerations about both joints which, in turn, caused the angular
velocities
to change. However, the angular momentum about the shoulder is
zero. The table on the right shows the local and remote terms of
angular momentum about the shoulder. Each segment has angular momentum
due to angular velocities that are not zero but the total is always
zero (there is a small amount of roundoff error that can be seen in the
column on the right).&nbsp;
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">You can use the data from the table on the left to
perform hand calculations like we did above and find the
total angular momentum at time 0.2 and at 0.3. You should find that at
both times the total angular momentum is zero.</font></p>

<p><img src="AngularMomentum6.jpg" align="right" height="443" width="616"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If we perform
the
same simulation
but activated the shoulder flexors and kept the elbow muscles relaxed
we would see that angular moment would increase from 0 to 0.1 seconds
and then remain constant.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The table on the right shows the angular momentum
for the shoulder moment simulation. Notice that the angular momentum
increases from zero to about 0.4 kg.m<sup>2</sup>/s at 0.1
seconds. The total angular momentum then remains 0.4 even though the
local and remote terms keep changing.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Conclusion:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Angular momentum may seem to be a fairly simple
extension of linear momentum to the rotational &nbsp;world but it
can have some fairly complex interactions when several segments are
involved. Many activities such as trampoline, tumbling, diving, etc.
require the manipulation and generation of angular momentum to achieve
the desired result.</font></p>
