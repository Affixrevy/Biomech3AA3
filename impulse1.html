  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The second method used to 
    solve kinetics problems is the impulse-momentum approach. This approach is 
    particularly useful when the force acts over a period time.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Impulse can be defined as 
    the product of force and time.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Impulse = Force x time</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Units are Newton seconds 
    (N.s)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example: If you apply a 
    100 N force to an object for 2 seconds, you have applied a 200 N.s impulse.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Impulse can also be defined 
    as the integral of force with respect to time.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="impulse1.jpg" width="400" height="150" align="left"></p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Recall from calculus that the integral is the same as the area.</font>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Impulse can also be defined 
    as a change in momentum.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Linear momentum is the product 
    of mass and velocity and has the units of kilogram meters per second (kg.m/s). 
    In order to have a lot of momentum, an object needs to have both a considerable 
    amount of mass and velocity. A statue may have a lot of mass but since it 
    is stationary, it has no momentum. Similarly, a golf ball may have considerable 
    velocity but since it does not have much mass, does not have a lot of momentum. 
    A speeding locomotive has both mass and velocity but requires a lot of impulse 
    in order to gain the velocity which means that a considerable amount of force 
    needs to be applied over a long time in order to achieve the neceassary increase 
    in velocity and momentum. A negative impulse causes a negative change in momentum 
    or a decrease in velocity. In the case of the locomotive, the brakes apply 
    a negative force but they must be applied over a considerable time in order 
    to generate a sufficient negative impulse to change the momentum back to zero 
    and stop the train.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The figure below shows that 
    impulse is indeed the same as a change in momentum.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Impulse is an important 
    variable in biomechanics because in most human motion studies, mass is constant 
    and therefore, impulse reflects a change in velocity.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">This graph shows the horizontal 
    force acting on a shot putter. The positive forces create a positive area 
    under the force-time curve and indicates a positive impulse. Th positive impulse 
    indicates a positive change or increase in momentum. From A to C, the athlete 
    gains velocity as he travels across the circle. From C to D, the force are 
    negative creating a negative area and causing a negative change in mometum. 
    This causes the athlete to slow down and prevents him from stepping out of 
    the circle at release. </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Factors that Increase Impulse:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In many sporting activities, 
    the object is to achieve the greatest final velocity possible and, therefore, 
    to generate the greatest impulse. These activities include the explosive or 
    ballistic motions of jumping or throwing. In order to increase impulse, one 
    or both of force and time must be increased.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">1) Increase average force 
    over the time of force application (increase strength).</font></p>
  <p><img src="impulse4.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Weight training is the 
    typical method of increasing the ability to generate force.</font></p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">2) Increase time over which 
    the force is applied (increase range of motion).</font></p>
  <p><img src="impulse5.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Maximizing the range of 
    motion by using a full back swing is a simple method of increasing the time 
    over which the force is applied.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Most textbooks of biomechanics 
    only mention these two methods, however, a characteristic of good performers 
    is generally a decrease in the time of force application. While this may seem 
    to be a contradiction, the rcovery stored elastic energy in muscle requires 
    a very short period of force application. Good athletes are able to utilize 
    this energy to generate a greater increase in force than a decrease in time 
    and thus a net increase in impulse.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">3</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">) 
    Increase impulse with a decrease in time (utilization of stored elastic energy).</font></p>
  <p><img src="impulse6.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Rebound movements like 
    the counter movement in the vertical jump is a common method to increase force 
    even though the time of force application is decreased.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The pattern of force application 
    is also a very important consideration with ballistic movements.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">4) Increase impulse with 
    the pattern of force application.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><img src="impulse7.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The 
    area under the dotted line pattern is greater than the straight line pattern. 
    Even though the maximum force and time are the same, the impulse is greater 
    for the dotted pattern. This has implications for motor learning because the 
    issue is not how much force you can generate but how you apply that force.</font></p>
