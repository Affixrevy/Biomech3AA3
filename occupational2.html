<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The most common
method of biomechanical analysis of heavy lifting and manual material
handling is to use a sagittal plane model of the human body and assume
static equilibrium to calculate joint moments and compression of the
spine at the L5-S1 joint. We also assume static equilibrium which may
seem like an over-simplification and the equations of dynamic
equilibrium would be more appropriate. &nbsp;While it is true that
lifting tasks are dynamic, the accelerations are quite low when the
load is high and therefore, the equations of static equilibrium yield
values that are very close to those of dynamic equilibrium.
&nbsp;In
addition, the data collection of a static analysis is much easier and
has produced a large database from which risk factors could be
calculated.</font></p>

Pressure Controversy:</big></font></p>
<img src="IAP.jpg" align="right" height="297" width="195">
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">It was
originally
proposed by Bartelink in 1957 that increased
intra-abdominal pressure
would decrease the compressive load on the spine through the
intra-abdominal balloon mechanism.
To begin with, you must think of the abdominal cavity and the abdominal
organs as a squishy liquid. Then realize
that the abdominal cavity becomes a closed chamber when we bear down
and hold our breath, which we instinctively do when we lift heavy
things. This chamber is closed on the bottom by the anal sphincter and
on the top by the diaphragm.
When bearing down, the abdominal contents tend to push outwards.
But if we contract our deep abdominal muscles (obliques and the
transverse
abdominus muscles) or we wear a thick belt, the abdominal contents are
forced upwards rather than outwards.
This theoretically provides a decompressive effect on the lumbar spine.
Since the crura of the diaphragm is attached
to the first 3 lumbar vertebrae, when the diaphragm is pushed upwards,
it exerts a traction force on the lower lumbar spine (L4 and L5).
It was also theorized that since this balloon
mechanism makes the spine more rigid, it would decrease the amount of
work required of the erector muscles to prevent us from falling
forwards. Kapanji estimated that
this abdominal support mechanism acts to reduce compression forces on
the L5/S1 disc by 30% and reduces the force required by the erector
spinae muscles by 55%. But more recent scientific evidence fails to
support some of these theoretical assumptions.
Such
recent studies reveal that an increase in intra-abdominal pressure
actually results in an increase (rather than a decrease) in compressive
force on the lower spine.(5,6) And there is no decrease in the amount
of work required of the lower back muscles.(7) However, by stiffening
the trunk, increased intra-abdominal pressure may prevent
the tissues in the spine from strain or failure from buckling.
Such intra-abdominal pressure may also act to reduce anterior-posterior
shear loads.(8)
In other words, support for the spine is provided, without reducing
compression to any appreciable degree.
Belts may also help to protect the spine by limiting the range of
motion that occurs when bending or twisting, though this effect is less
than expected.(9,10)

<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
since when the spine bends more, it is more vulnerable to injury, if
these belts reduce extreme bending at all, they may be beneficial.

<h1><b><font size="4"><i>Are
there any risks associated with wearing a
back belt?</i><o:p>
</o:p></font></b></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The main risk
associated with wearing a back belt is that during the period of
wearing it, the supportive spinal muscles&mdash;the deep abdominal
and
back muscles&mdash;that normally support your spine will become
weaker.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These muscles are less active
while your spine
is being artificially supported by the belt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Muscles
need to be consistently exercised in order to stay strong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If these muscles become
weaker, when you stop wearing the belt,
you may be more likely to hurt your back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
at least one study seems to suggest this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this study, there was an increase in the number and severity of back
injuries following a period of belt wearing.(11) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Another risk
associated with wearing a back belt is that it causes an increase in
both blood pressure and heart rate.(12)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
may pose a problem for those individuals with existing cardiovascular
disease or risk factors, such as hypertension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A third risk
associated with wearing a back belt is that workers may be inclined to
lift heavier objects while wearing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
belts may be giving workers a false sense of security.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This could result in an
increased risk of injury.<span style="">&nbsp;

<br>
<br>
</font><font size="4">Should you wear a belt to support your back
and
prevent injury?</font></i><font size="4"><o:p> </o:p></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">My recommendation
is that you should wear a supportive belt only for the first few days
or weeks after a severe back injury while the area is healing or only
during the lifting of very heavy objects. If you have never had a back
injury, I would avoid a belt entirely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is more important to focus on using proper form and posture when
bending and lifting and even sitting, and to perform conditioning
exercises regularly to keep your trunk muscles strong.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Before requiring
all your workers to wear back belts, it would be better to have a
comprehensive ergonomic assessment of the work stations to see what can
be done to reduce overloading the spine while at work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Workers should be educated
about how the tissues of the spine
become injured, proper lifting mechanics to minimize such strain, and
what to do when feeling back discomfort prior to a severe injury
occurring.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All workers should be
encouraged to engage in a regular fitness program, to lose weight if
heavy, and to avoid smoking.<o:p> </o:p></span></p>

&nbsp;Everybody has experienced a foot or hand that has "fallen

realizing that the task has negative effects on muscle and nerve.
