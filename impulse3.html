<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A very useful
application of the conservation of momentum is in the area of impacts
or collisions. Before looking at an example of this, we must first
understand elasticity.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Elasticity: </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Elasticity (e)
is that property of a body that causes it to return to its original
shape after being deformed in an impact. If we consider the collision
between object A and object B, we can calculate the elasticity of that
collision by looking at the relative velocities before and after the
impact. Elasticity is the ratio of the velocity after the impact
(separation) to the velocity before the impact of the two objects.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The symbol (e)
is often called the coefficient of restitution and it is a untiless
number between zero and one. When the coefficient of restitution is
zero, there is no tendancy to return to the original shape and this is
called perfectly plastic. When the coefficient is 1.0 there is an
absolute tendancy to return to the original shape and this is called
perfectly elastic.</font> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Conservation of
Momentum in an impact:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Consider two
objects A and B that collide. The total momentum of the two objects
after the impact is equal to the momentum prior to the
impact. The equation below shows this equality and illustrates how
momentum is conserved in an impact.</font></p>
