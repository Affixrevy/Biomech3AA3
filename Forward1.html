Dynamics and Human Movement Simulation</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The lecture on
<a href="dynamic1.html">dynamic
equilibrium</a> used Newton's second
law and the inverse dynamics
approach to solve the internal kinetics (joint reaction forces and net
joint moments). &nbsp;Inverse dynamics is used when masses
(inertia)
and accelerations (kinematics) are known and forces (kinetics) are
calculated. The forward dynamics approach is used when the kinetics and
inertia are known and the kinematics are calculated. The diagram at the
right shows a single segment controlled by a moment of force or torque
that tends to rotate the segment about the proximal end (T<sub>1</sub>).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The angular acceleration can be calculated by
dividing the
net joint moment (T<sub>1</sub>) by the moment of inertia.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Once the angular
acceleration is
found, the angular velocity and angular displacement can be determined
via
integration. This integration is performed by the computer in a way
that is similar to the method that we used to find the velocity and
displacement of an object falling with <a href="air1.html">air
resistance</a>. Namely, the
acceleration is considered to have occurred for a very short period of
time and the area or velocity is determined by multiplying the
acceleration by the time interval. The displacement is found by
considering that velocity occurred for the same short time period and
multiplying the velocity by that time. The computer iteratively
calculates accelerations, velocities and displacements for many small
time intervals over the period of the simulation. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><img src="forward7.jpg" align="middle" height="420" width="1254"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A system of two
segments controlled by T<sub>1</sub>
and T<sub>2</sub>
is more complicated.&nbsp; The angular acceleration of segment 1 is
effected by more than just T<sub>1</sub>.
&nbsp;There are two equations
which must be solved to yield the two angular accelerations.</font></p>

<p><img src="forward2.jpg" align="middle" height="280" width="1172"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The angular
accelerations of the two&nbsp;segments
are affected by the angular velocity of segment 2 due to coriolis
effects which is affected by the relative joint angle as well as the
masses, lengths and moments of inertia.
&nbsp;The example below shows a very simple situation of a system
at rest and only a moment generated about joint 2.</font></p>

<p><img src="forward4.jpg" align="right" height="460" width="620"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">It can be seen
that even though T<sub>1</sub>
= 0, both segments accelerate due to the interactions between the two
segments. T<sub>2</sub>
causes a positive acceleration of segment 2 which is expected but it
also caused a negative acceleration of segment 1.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="forward5.jpg" align="left" height="450" width="725"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The
accelerations
above will cause changes in the segment velocities and the joint angles
which will cause the accelerations to change even if T<sub>1</sub>
and T<sub>2</sub>
remain 0 N.m and 4 N.m, respectively. Computer simulations perform the
integrations of these accelerations over a very short time period to
obtain the changes in velocity and displacement and then re-calculate
the new accelerations in an iterative process that simulates the
movement outcomes of the joint moments (T<sub>1</sub>
and T<sub>2</sub>).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The table on
the
left is the output from a computer simulation of the above example that
T<sub>2</sub>
= 4 N.m for 0.1 seconds and then both moments are zero.
&nbsp;It can be seen that the velocities (Omega2 and Omega1) change
and
so too do the joint angles (Theta2 and Theta1). &nbsp;Also notice
that
the segments continue to accelerate even after the moments are turned
off (after 0.1 seconds). &nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">A three segment
system becomes even more involved with the equations becoming much
longer and the need to solve the three unknowns simultaneously (see
below).
&nbsp;Computer methods allow the solution to be found and enable
the biomechanics researcher to create fairly complex multi-segment
models of the human body and calculate the resulting accelerations from
known joint torques.</font></p>

<p><img src="forward6.jpg" align="middle" height="340" width="1140"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">It
is even possible to replace the joint
torques with individual muscle forces for an even higher degree of
similarity to human movement and conduct experiments on the best way to
perform a skill. &nbsp;Such experiments have used the term "<span style="font-style: italic;">in-silico</span>"
to separate an experiment performed by computer simulation from other
biological terms such as "<span style="font-style: italic;">in-vivo</span>",
"<span style="font-style: italic;">in-vitro</span>"
and <span style="font-style: italic;">in-situ</span>".</font></p>

understanding:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">1) "Don't know
what happened" - no observation, description or empirical evidence</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">2) "Know what

know kinetic causes</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">3) "Know the
causes but don't know how to change the result" - kinetic analysis but
unsure of the consequences of making a change</font></p>

happened, why it happened and how to change the outcome".</font></p>
