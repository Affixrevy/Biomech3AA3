<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Assessment of
Fatigue:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The previous
page showed how isometric muscle force could be estimated from EMG.
&nbsp;It was stated that this only applied to non-fatigued muscle.
&nbsp;In this section we look at how EMG changes with fatigue and
how it can be a useful tool in industry.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Amplitude
changes:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The figure to
the
right shows the raw EMG of a subject holding a sustained isometric
contraction for two minutes. &nbsp;The task was a submaximum effort
of
about 50% MVC and resulted in a fairly low level of EMG at the
beginning. &nbsp;The subject was able to maintain the force
throughout
the two minute task but we can see that the EMG started to increase
after 60 seconds. &nbsp;The figure has been compressed by only
looking
at 1 second intervals during the trial in order to make the increase in
EMG more obvious. &nbsp;After 120 seconds, the subject was exerting
their maximum effort just to maintain the submaximal force.
&nbsp;They
recruited more motor units and increased the firing rates of all motor
units to compensate for the loss of contractility due to fatigue.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Frequency
changes:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Electromyographers
can also examine the frequency content of the raw EMG signal to assess
fatigue. A spectral analysis of raw EMG shows that most of the signal
lies between 10 and 250 hz. See the <a href="FrequencyDomain1.html">Frequency
Domain
Processing
Lab</a> for more on the topic of
frequency domain signal processing. &nbsp;Briefly, it is a process
of
breaking down a time domain signal into frequency components.
&nbsp;This allows the biomechanist to see noise or other features
not easily recognized in the more traditional time domain plots.

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">An average
plot of this sprectrum is shown to the right. &nbsp;A good measure
of the EMG frequency distribution is given by the "median frequency"
which divides
the distribution into two equal halves by area. &nbsp;The
figure
below shows this for a fresh muscle in Blue and for a fatigued muscle
in red. &nbsp;We can see that the area under the red curve is
larger due to the increased amplitude of the EMG signal noted earlier.
&nbsp;But we can also see that the median frequency has also
shifted to a lower frequency. The reason for the shift to lower
frequencies is due to the slowing of conduction velocity of the action
potentials along the muscle fibers. &nbsp;Conduction velocity slows
due
to lactic acid accumulation with fatigue.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Tremor and motor
unit synchronization:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Another
phenomenon
that is often present during fatigue is muscle tremor. Under normal
conditions, the CNS utilizes asynchronous firing of many motor units
for a smooth generation of force. &nbsp;However, at maximum efforts
and
extreme fatigue, the motor units tend to fire more synchronously which
results in tremor which can be seen as visable shaking:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In conclusion,
biomechanics
uses
EMG to assess fatigue in industry. &nbsp;Most industrial tasks are
repeated sub-maximal efforts. &nbsp;As we can see in the figures
above,
EMG
shows signs of fatigue before the force changes or the task can no
longer be completed. Therefore, the use of EMG allows ergonomists to
see when fatigue begins for a given task and design the work place that
allows either a rest or a change in activity to keep the muscles from
becoming fatigued..</font></p>

Prosthetics</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Most prosthetic
limbs for upper extremity amputees used passive hooks or body-powered
clasping mechanisms. &nbsp;The use of externally powered
prosthetics
were too heavy due to the weight of motors, battery power, etc to be
used. &nbsp;Today, the weight is less of an issue (due to micro
electronics and lithium batteries) and muscles in
the
residual limb can be used for control. &nbsp;The patient must be
able
to produce 10-15 microvolts of EMG to&nbsp;activate the system.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Electrodes are
placed strategically. &nbsp;In the case of trans-radial amputees,
electrodes are placed over wrist and finger flexor muscle groups and
the opening is triggered by electrodes over the extensors. Some single
control systems used for children act to open the clasp and it closes
upon relaxation. Trans-humeral amputees have dual systems and quad
control that control elbow flexion/extension as well as clasp opening
and closing.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">One big
difference
between myo-electric prostheses is that a sock or sheath cannot be used
because it will interfere with electrode-skin interface.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Early devices
were
constant velocity but Parker and Scott in 1995, introduced control that
modulated speed and grip force based on the amount of EMG.</font></p>
