<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">As mentioned in
the&nbsp;(<a href="QuantitativeLab1.html">Quantitative
Lab</a>)</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">, other
kinematic variables such as
velocity and acceleration can be determined from the position and time
information collected during motion capture</font><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">. &nbsp;The
purpose of this lab is to
show how displacement data from motion capture can be processed to
yield velocity and acceleration data.

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The table to the
left shows the output from a film analysis of a ball falling after
being dropped from a height 1.8 meters. &nbsp;The film camera was
set
at 100 frames per second but was found to be actually filming at a rate
of 101 frames per second.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The first column
shows the digitized vertical positions of the ball in each frame.
&nbsp;These positions are considered to be the vertical
displacement
from the ground. &nbsp;Since these data represent discrete values
of a
continuously changing position of the falling ball, we cannot use
calculus to differentiate the displacement to yield velocity or
acceleration. &nbsp;However, the computer can use a method of
finite
differences to yield values for velocity and acceleration. This method
is shown below.</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Central
Finite Differences:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since the
computer
only knows the position of the ball at discrete times, it must estimate
the slope to get a derivative. In the diagram below, let's assume the
red line to be the true, continuous trajectory of an object.
&nbsp;The
black circles are the digitized positions of the object at three
subsequent times (frames). &nbsp;If we wish to know the velocity at
time (t), we would ideally want to calculate the tangent to the red
line at that instant (see the green line). &nbsp;However,
&nbsp;the
computer can only perform &nbsp;calculations on the discrete
position
data so the best estimate of the tangent at time &nbsp;t would be
average slope between t-1 and t+1. &nbsp;We will let deltat t
represent the time between each frame.<img
 style="width: 1000px; height: 424px;" alt=""

<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
velocity
would be the rise divided by the run. &nbsp;Using our ball drop
experiment data and calculating the velocity for the fourth frame, we
would use the displacement from the third frame (t-1) and the
displacement from the fifth frame (t+1) and a deltat t of 0.0099 (101
frames per second) and perform the calculation below.</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><img
 style="width: 870px; height: 118px;" alt="" src="Differentiation2b.jpg"></span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">This
process would be repeated to yield the velocities for each frame and
the entire procedure would be performed on the velocity data to yield
accelerations. If we
plot the resulting velocity and acceleration calculations, we get the
following:</span></big></p>
<p><img src="Differentiation3.jpg" align="left" height="607" width="600"></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
figure to the
left shows the original displacement data in the first column.
&nbsp;A computer program, using the central finite differences
method above, printed out velocities and&nbsp;accelerations in the
second and third columns, respectively. &nbsp;These data are then
plotted in the respective graphs.</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">We know
from
projectile motion that velocity should be a linearly decreasing
function with a slope of -9.81 and the acceleration should be a
constant -9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
&nbsp;When we look at the graphs, we see the negative tend is
appearent in velocity but the line is not straight. &nbsp;The
acceleration data has huge fluctuations and is not even close to the
constant -9.81. &nbsp;Does this mean that central finite
differences is a poor method for differentiation?</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
reason for
the derivative errors is the fact that the displacement data have small
high frequency noise (errors) that are not very noticable in the
displacement plot. &nbsp;The process of differentiation magifies
these high frequency errors which is why the errors are much more
obvious in the second derivative than in the first derivative.</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
solution to
better derivatives is not to find a better differentiation method, but
to filter out the high frequency noise. &nbsp;The method for
filtering will be discussed in the <a href="FrequencyDomain1.html">"Frequency
Domain
Processing"</a> lecture.</span></big></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"><u>Integration</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Sometimes we
have acceleration data from an accelerometer and we would need to
integrate the data once to get velocity and twice to get displacement.
&nbsp;We also did a form of integration in the <a
 href="InpulseLab1.html">Impulse/Momentum
Lab</a> when we
counted squares to get impulse from a force-time curve of the vertical
jump. &nbsp;Calculating an integral is the same as finding the area
under the curve</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">.
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Rectangle
Rule:</big></font></big></p>
<p><img src="Differentiation4.jpg" align="right" height="400"
 width="350"></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
simplest way
to estimate the
area is to multiply the data sample by the time interval (delta t).
&nbsp;That is to calculate the base times the height of a rectangle
and add up the areas. &nbsp;The shaded blue area is the estimate of
the area under the curve using this rectangle method. &nbsp;Notice
that the methof under-estimates the area when the function is
increasing and over-estimates the area when the function is decreasing.</span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"></span></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
accuracy of
the method is increased by increasing the sampling rate which decreases
delta t.</span></big></p>

Rule:</big></font></big></p>
<p><img src="Differentiation5.jpg" align="right" height="360"

<p><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">The
accuracy of the rectangle can be improved by adding a triangle on top
of the rectangle to yield a trapezoid.</span></big>&nbsp;</p>
