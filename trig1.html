  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Scalars: A scalar is a quantity 
    that has magnitude only such as mass, energy, and time.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Vectors: A vector is a quantity 
    that has magnitude and direction such as force and velocity.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">These lectures will distinguish 
    vector quantities from scalars by underlining the labels of vectors. Since 
    vectors have both magnitude and direction, the notation must include both. 
    Below is an example of vector notation of a force 100 Newtons that acts at 
    an angle of 40 degrees above horizontal.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Vectors can also be shown 
    graphically with an arrow and a scale. The 100 N force vector above could 
    be shown graphically with an arrow that is pointing upward at a 40 degree 
    angle and with a length of 5 cm (see below).</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In Biomechanics, we often 
    need to add vectors in order to determine the net effect. Since vectors have 
    magnitude and direction, we must take the direction into account when we add 
    vectors. We do this graphically by adding the vectors in a &quot;tip to tail&quot; 
    fashion. That is, we arrange the vectors such that the tail of one vector 
    is placed at the tip of the vector that it is to be added to. We do this without 
    changing the direction of any of the vectors. The graphical addition of two 
    vectors is shown below.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">The vector <u>C</u> is 
    called the resultant and its size could be measured with a ruler and its direction 
    could be measured with a protractor.</font></p>
