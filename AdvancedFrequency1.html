lab that a signal can be transformed from the time domain into the
frequency domain that allows better matching of transducers to signals,
appropriate sampling rates by the computer (A/D) converter, better
noise removal by filtering and even fatigue detection via raw <a

&nbsp;This lecture shows exactly how the Fourier Transform is
calculated and how a digital filter is designed.

Transform:</big></font></big></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We are familiar
with the appearance of a sine wave in the time domain. &nbsp;We
know that the sine wave is characterized by its amplitude and frequency
with larger waves having greater amplitude and higher frequency wave
having more cycles per second (Hz). The same sine wave can be
represented in the frequency domain with a single vertical line that
shows its amplitude and frequency (see figure to the right).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In terms of pure
mathematics, the Fourier Transform is an integral shown by the
following formula:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Assuming we sampled
the signal witha computer, the finite mathematics uses the following
summation formula:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Let us use the
example of a square wave signal sampled at 64 samples per second that
has an amplitude of 1.0 and a frequency of 1.0.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="FrequencyDomain2.jpg" align="left" height="460" width="250"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It turns out
that any time domain signal can be broken down to a series of sine
waves and represented in the frequency domain. &nbsp;The figure on
the left shows five sine waves at the top in the time domain.
&nbsp;When these sine waves are added together to yield a one
signal and plotted in the time domain, we see the comlex signal in the
middle. &nbsp;If we could take the signal in the middle and break
it down into frequencies and amplitudes, we could plot the signal in
the frequency domain. &nbsp;The graph on the bottom shows the
frequency domain plot and we can clearly see the amplitudes and
frequencies of the original sine waves.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">There is a
mathematical technique discovered by the french mathematician, Joseph
Fourier (1768-1830) called the "Fourier Transform" that transforms time
domain
signals into frequency domain signals. &nbsp;The figure below shows
a raw EMG signal in both the time domain and the frequency domain.
&nbsp;Modern computer algorithms use the "Fast Fourier Transform"
often refered to as an FFT. A more in-depth look at the FFT is examined
in the <a href="AdvancedFrequency1.html">

Filtering:</big></font></big></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Now that we can
see signals in the frequency domain, we can determine the fatigue state
of muscle, match the frequency response of a transducer, sample a
signal at a high enough rate and remove high frequency noise from
displacement data. &nbsp;The last point will be covered in this
section.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Lowpass Filter -
One of the most widely used filters in biomechanics is the lowpass
filter. &nbsp;This filter removes high frequency noise from
displacement data so that accurate derivatives can be found using the
central finite differences method we learned in the signal processing
lab.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The diagram to
the right shows the frequency response of a lowpass filter. Like the
name implies, it passes the lower frequencies and attenuates the higher
frequencies. &nbsp;One way to visualize this process is to imagine
that the sine waves of the lower frequencies are multiplied by one
(gain = 1) and the higher frequencies are multiplied by numbers
approaching zero. &nbsp;The frequency that distinguishes between
the frequencies with a gain of one and the attenuated frequencies is
called the cutoff frequency (fc). There are different types of lowpass
filters, the most common is the Butterworth filter. &nbsp;The
design and application of different filters is a topic of the

 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Highpass Filter
- When low frequencies are to be eliminated and high frequencies
maintained, we use a highpass filter. &nbsp;Integration of
accelerometer data is highly prone to low frequency noise.</font></font></p>

 face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Bandpass Filter
- EMG has a bandwidth between 10 and 500 Hz so we would like to remove
frequencies below 10 and above 500. &nbsp;The banpass filter uses
two cutoff frequencies to combine low and highpass filters.</font></font></p>

Filter (Notch Filter) - The removeal of 60Hz interference from EMG
requires a filter that rejects 60Hz and keeps the other frequencies.</font></font></p>
