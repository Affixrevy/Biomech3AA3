t gets
smaller, the average velocity gets closer to the instantaneous
velocity. However, since we cannot divide by zero, we cannot calculate
V when &Delta; t = 0.</font></p>

Calculus</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Sir Isaac
Newton
developed a method to calculate instantaneous slopes called
"differential calculus". The method requires the knowledge of functions
from the previous page and transforms the displacement function into a
velocity function. We already know that the displacement function
allows us to calculate the displacement at any instant in time.
Therefore, if we can transform displacement into a velocity function,
we can calculate the velocity at any instant (i.e. when t = 2 seconds)
without calculating an average velocity or dividing by zero.</font></p>
<p><img src="calculus5.jpg" align="middle" height="200" width="670"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In order to
transform the displacement function into the velocity function we must
use the following transfer function for differential calculus.</font></p>

<p><img src="calculus7.jpg" align="middle" height="200" width="670"> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In order to
transform this velocity function into the acceleration function, we
must differentiate a second time. This is done using the same transfer
fuction as before on the terms in the velocity function.</font></p>

<p align="left"><img src="calculus9.jpg" align="right" height="430"
 width="200"> <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Now, we have
three
functions that perfectly describe the displacement, velocity and
acceleration of the object at any point in time. If we plot the three
functions, they will look like those to the right.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We use these
equations to exactly answer questions like "What is the velocity at two
seconds?"</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Notice that the
velocity function is the slope of the displacement function. As the
slope of the displacement function increases between 0 and 2 seconds,
the velocity increases. As the slope of the displacement function
decreases between 2 and 4 seconds, the velocity decreases. As the slope
of the displacement function becomes negative after 4 seconds, the
velocity does also.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Calculus is a
very
important tool in biomechaincs because we often measure displacement
using video and then differentiate twice to get acceleration which can
be multiplied by mass to yield force. &nbsp;Velocity is important
for
energy, work and power calculations. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Although
displacement, velocity and acceleration are the most commonly used
derivatives in biomechanics,&nbsp;higher derivatives have also been
used. The rate of force application (called "yank") has received
attention for muscle capacity and in the design of roller coasters and
elevators.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Among some of
the
most important things that designers of roller coasters must pay
attention to are the acceleration, rate of change of acceleration
"jerk" and the rate of change of jerk "snap". &nbsp;These third,
fourth
and fifth derivatives of displacement are thought to be important for
making the ride exciting and sufficiently scary without being
uncomfortable and risking bodily harm or structural collapse.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">What is the
jerk
and snap in the above example?</font>
